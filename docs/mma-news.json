Sonnen explains why, from a practical betting and logistical standpoint, these offers rarely make sense. Using Vince Morales as a starting point, he explores the mechanics of fight-fixing, the limits of sportsbooks, and the extreme repercussions for fighters who might consider taking such a deal. Chael also draws on his personal experience in MMA and wrestling to explain how fight-fixing has worked historically — from Pride to international competitions — showing how a single locker-room approach or incentive could subtly influence a bout without turning it into scripted theater. He dissects the fine line between real corruption, attempted manipulation, and pure rumor, while emphasizing that these incidents are extremely uncommon and come with enormous risks for any fighter.

In classic Chael fashion, he starts by talking about today’s sponsor, House of Atlas, a premium shaving brand that impressed even “The Bad Guy.” From there, he transitions into a sharp, layered breakdown of Rousey’s GOAT claim — pointing out that without legitimate rankings, depth in the division, or proven successors after her exit, there’s simply no measurable way to validate the gap she claims to have created. Chael compares Rousey’s career to that of Georges St-Pierre, explaining how GSP’s greatness was proven not just by dominance, but by the champions who rose only after he stepped away. For Ronda, the numbers, context, and opponents just don’t tell the same story. Still, Sonnen gives credit where it’s due — acknowledging that Rousey changed women’s MMA forever and built something from almost nothing. But when it comes to being the greatest of all time, Chael argues that history is written by those who beat the next era, not just the first one.

In classic Chael fashion, he explains why declining opportunities doesn’t make a fighter noble — it makes him unemployed. Sonnen dives into the real consequences of an event cancellation, the financial hit promoters take, and what it reveals about fighters who posture online but freeze when the call comes in. With his trademark wit and business insight, Chael outlines the risk, the fallout, and what happens when ego costs you momentum.

According to Francis, MVP called him directly. They didn’t call to “talk business.” They called to offer him the fight. Only problem? Francis didn’t even realize that’s what was happening. So Jake Paul’s camp tries to make the fight. Francis says no. And now, everyone’s asking the same question — why? I’ll tell you what happened, why Francis got offended, and why this could go down as one of the strangest missed opportunities in combat sports history. Because at some point, turning down fights doesn’t make you a noble man… it makes you unemployed.

      "description": "Daniel Cormier IS BACK after huge news broke in the boxing world: Jake Paul and Gervonta \"Tank\" Davis' fight is officially canceled. The exhibition boxing fight was canceled by MVP Promotions due to Tank's run-in with the law, and DC gives his take on why this fight SHOULD HAVE NEVER happened in the first place. Plus, Cormier argues that Jake Paul calling out former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou is a huge mistake. DC says that despite his loss to Anthony Joshua, Francis will \"knock Jake's head\" to ANOTHER PLANET if the two were to fight.
