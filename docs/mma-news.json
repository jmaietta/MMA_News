      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGs5bHJ6cMA",
      "description": "Chael Sonnen just left Ariel Helwani’s studio — and let’s just say things got tense. Chael reveals that Ariel was irritated with him after Chael said he didn’t even know Weili Zhang and Valentina Shevchenko were fighting until last week. But here’s the twist: even Ariel hadn’t promoted the fight on his own show. Chael questions how a supposed “superfight” between two all-time greats could fly under everyone’s radar — including ESPN, the UFC, and even Helwani himself. Sonnen breaks down why the UFC’s marketing dropped the ball, how Valentina’s incredible career has been hidden in co-main events, and why fans (and media) deserve better. 🔥 Full of classic Chael logic, dry humor, and uncomfortable truths. #ChaelSonnen #ArielHelwani #UFC #WeiliZhang #ValentinaShevchenko #MMA #UFCNews #Bullet #UFCMedia #HelwaniShow #MMAFighting Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "\"Overreaction Time\" (Tuesdays, noon ET) is a weekly podcast hosted by MMA Junkie managing editor Simon Samano where he shares his \"overreactions\" with an MMA Junkie staff member, and the debate begins! On this edition, he and MMA Junkie reporter Nolan King discuss the following: (00:00) - Intro (01:25) - UFC 322: Even though Jack Della Maddalena is the champion, Islam Makhachev has more at stake. (08:09) - UFC 322: Whoever wins between Valentina Shevchenko and Zhang Weili will establish herself as the second greatest female fighter ever. (15:17) - UFC 322: Outside of the main and co-main, the fighter under the most pressure is Bo Nickal. (22:03) - Francis Ngannou is above fighting Jake Paul and was smart to decline his offer. (27:49) - Dana White’s big talk of cracking down on fight-fixing means nothing without any action.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cB6w7gDb1o",
      "description": "Chael Sonnen breaks down one of the most fascinating redemption stories in MMA — the rise, fall, and rebirth of Mohammad Mokaev. Once a 14–0 phenom ranked top-3 in the world, Mokaev suddenly found himself off the main card, out of the UFC, and facing rumors that his contract — or reputation — had run out. But as Chael reveals, what happened next defines character. Mokaev didn’t complain, didn’t point fingers — he went to work. Competing in Brave CF, taking grappling matches, and showing he’s still one of the most skilled and disciplined fighters on the planet. Sonnen calls Mokaev’s journey a “case study” in how a fighter handles adversity the right way — with humility, consistency, and class. From owning past mistakes to earning another shot at the big stage, Chael believes Mokaev’s story isn’t finished — it’s just getting started. “If he makes it back,” Chael says, “the UFC won’t rebuild him — they’ll fast-track him.” This is more than a comeback story. It’s about accountability, growth, and the fighter’s code — something Chael Sonnen knows better than anyone. #MohammadMokaev #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMA #BraveCF #Redemption #UFCReturn #FighterMindset Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
