      "description": "Click here https://bearmattress.com/chael and use CODE: CHAEL to get 40% off your mattress. Merab Dvalishvili has been named MMA Junkie’s 2025 Male Fighter of the Year, and let me be clear — this isn’t an attack. This is a conversation. In MMA, we’ve always handled losses differently than boxing. Thanks to the culture built by Dana White, fighters aren’t erased by defeat. You can lose, rebound, and still headline arenas. That’s part of what makes this sport great. But when we talk about Fighter of the Year, the criteria matter. Merab walked four times, all in world title fights. He went 3–1. That’s impressive. No argument there. But Joshua Van also walked four times. He went 4–0. He finished the year as champion. So here’s the question: Do title fights outweigh results? Does difficulty matter more than outcome? And how do we reconcile one fighter ending the year with the belt — and the other without it? I made a similar argument years ago for Alex Pereira, and it didn’t land then. Maybe it lands now. Merab had an outstanding year. He deserves recognition. I’ve got him in my top three. But if we’re going to hand out Fighter of the Year honors, we owe it to the sport to explain why. Let’s talk about it. #UFC #MMA #MerabDvalishvili #FighterOfTheYear #MMADebate #ChaelSonnen Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

From the production to the movement to the way this fight felt, this wasn’t some scripted spectacle. This was competition. Real fear. Real survival. Real fighting. Jake Paul wasn’t running because he was scared — he was moving because he had to. Distance, geometry, timing. These are things you only understand once you’ve been hit. Anyone calling this “fake” has never been in a real fight, and I’ll explain exactly why. Yes, it’s disappointing that Joshua couldn’t end it early. Yes, that matters. But that doesn’t erase what Jake did: stepping into a weight class he doesn’t belong in, against an Olympic champion, and surviving a night most people wouldn’t last 30 seconds in. You don’t have to like Jake Paul. But if you respect fighting — your respect for him just went up. Watch the breakdown.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPqN2D-RvDk",
      "description": "Terence Crawford says he’s retired… nd Chael Sonnen flat-out doesn’t believe him. In this clip, Chael explains why “retirement” announcements in combat sports often feel like a scripted promo—and why that’s a dangerous game. Chael argues that once athletes start using the media for attention instead of truth, it drags real sports closer to professional wrestling logic: angles, resets, headlines, and manufactured moments. Chael’s bigger point is simple: retiring at the top doesn’t add up. If you sacrificed your entire life to become king of the world, why walk away the moment you finally reach the dream? Chael also questions the timing—during a week when boxing has major events competing for oxygen, a retirement headline feels less like a farewell and more like a spotlight grab. And here’s the part Chael takes seriously: words stick. Even if it starts as marketing, telling yourself “I’ve done it all” can kill the hunger it takes to stay elite—those 5 a.m. miles, the discipline, the grind. Chael respects Crawford as a fighter and as a man—but he wants honesty from the top guys, because once sport turns into promos, the whole thing gets tainted. #TerenceCrawford #ChaelSonnen #Boxing #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #CombatSports #MMA #UFC #FightNews #SportsMediaBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Ilia Topuria addressed concerns about potential allegations and made it clear he will not compete until everything is resolved — but that decision has created serious consequences for the division. With Topuria sidelined, the UFC title picture stalls, and the biggest casualty may be Arman Tsarukyan, the clear number one contender who still hasn’t received his championship opportunity. As matchmaking shifts toward other fights, questions continue to grow: Should a champion hold the belt if they refuse to compete? What happens to contenders left waiting with no timeline? And how long can the UFC afford to freeze an entire division? This breakdown looks at Ilia Topuria’s stance, Arman Tsarukyan’s stalled title path, and why uncertainty at the top creates chaos for everyone underneath.",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm49p6hQPfc",
      "description": "Should Ilia Topuria be stripped of the UFC lightweight title? Chael Sonnen doesn’t want that — but he also doesn’t know how the UFC avoids it. After a clip from The MMA Hour set off a firestorm, Chael clarifies what people missed: this isn’t about being “against Ilia.” It’s about how the fight business actually runs — precedent over feelings. Chael argues the UFC has an ethical problem either way. If you strip Ilia, you risk crowning a champion the promotion doesn’t truly believe is “the guy.” But if the champion isn’t defending — and it’s not clearly injury or illness — the entire structure of title fights starts to collapse. That’s where the interim belt is supposed to live: the “in-between.” Chael compares this situation to past champions who stepped away and the UFC moved on. The question becomes brutally simple: if nothing changes, and eventually you’d have to take the belt anyway… what’s the justification for waiting? Chael doesn’t claim this is open-and-shut. He wants the audience to make the best argument against stripping Ilia — and to explain why the rules should bend here. Watch, weigh in, and tell Chael what he’s missing. #IliaTopuria #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMA #UFCNews #Lightweight #InterimTitle #MMADebate #ArielHelwani Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sudMywUKm1I",
      "description": "Anthony Joshua vs Jake Paul might be the most talked-about fight in boxing — but it’s also one of the biggest sporting mismatches of our lifetime. The betting odds don’t fully reflect the massive gap in skill, experience, and power, and there’s a reason for that. Some fans believe this fight is scripted or “entertainment,” similar to pro wrestling. That belief — not confidence in Jake Paul’s boxing — is why the odds aren’t historically wide. The reality? This is not a work, not a setup, and not David vs Goliath. Anthony Joshua is an Olympic gold medalist, a former unified heavyweight champion, and one of the most proven power punchers in boxing history. Jake Paul stepping into the ring with him is unprecedented — and dangerously real. This breakdown explains why the matchup looks the way it does, why the odds exist, and why the outcome shouldn’t surprise anyone who understands combat sports.",

      "description": "Anthony Joshua raised eyebrows by ranking Jake Paul ahead of Tyson Fury in his heavyweight rankings — and it didn’t land the way he hoped. This wasn’t confidence. It was promotion. And it may have cost Joshua credibility instead of building anticipation. Joshua never faced anyone as inexperienced as Jake Paul in his amateur career, let alone at the elite level. When you’re already the king, you don’t need to exaggerate the threat — you let the result speak for itself. There are very few moments in a fighter’s career when victory feels inevitable. This is one of them. And instead of enjoying that position, Joshua tried to manufacture danger where none exists. Sometimes the smartest move is saying nothing at all.",
