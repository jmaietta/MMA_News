In this clip, Chael breaks down what it really means to be a “prize fighter,” why calling TMZ isn’t the move, and why refusing a challenge in public says everything about a fighter’s mindset. Watch Chael unpack the psychology, the pride, and the money behind Ngannou’s decision — and why on Chael’s playground, there’s only one rule: you don’t back down. 👉 Comment below — was Francis right to pass, or should a real prize fighter always step up?",

In classic Chael fashion, he gives credit where it’s due — but calls out the myth of the “untouchable GOAT.” 👉 Watch now and tell us: does Ronda still deserve the title of the greatest?",

Sonnen explains why, from a practical betting and logistical standpoint, these offers rarely make sense. Using Vince Morales as a starting point, he explores the mechanics of fight-fixing, the limits of sportsbooks, and the extreme repercussions for fighters who might consider taking such a deal. Chael also draws on his personal experience in MMA and wrestling to explain how fight-fixing has worked historically — from Pride to international competitions — showing how a single locker-room approach or incentive could subtly influence a bout without turning it into scripted theater. He dissects the fine line between real corruption, attempted manipulation, and pure rumor, while emphasizing that these incidents are extremely uncommon and come with enormous risks for any fighter.

In classic Chael fashion, he starts by talking about today’s sponsor, House of Atlas, a premium shaving brand that impressed even “The Bad Guy.” From there, he transitions into a sharp, layered breakdown of Rousey’s GOAT claim — pointing out that without legitimate rankings, depth in the division, or proven successors after her exit, there’s simply no measurable way to validate the gap she claims to have created. Chael compares Rousey’s career to that of Georges St-Pierre, explaining how GSP’s greatness was proven not just by dominance, but by the champions who rose only after he stepped away. For Ronda, the numbers, context, and opponents just don’t tell the same story. Still, Sonnen gives credit where it’s due — acknowledging that Rousey changed women’s MMA forever and built something from almost nothing. But when it comes to being the greatest of all time, Chael argues that history is written by those who beat the next era, not just the first one.

The exhibition boxing fight was canceled by MVP Promotions due to Tank's run-in with the law, and DC gives his take on why this fight SHOULD HAVE NEVER happened in the first place. Plus, Cormier argues that Jake Paul calling out former UFC heavyweight champion Francis Ngannou is a huge mistake.

In this episode, Chael explores the gray area between fight fixing, insider information, and integrity in sports betting — and how easily those lines can blur when money and opportunity collide. From real-life stories of boxers offering cash mid-fight to the recent scandals shaking up the NBA and MMA, Chael exposes how insider knowledge — even overheard in a coffee shop — can cross into federal crime territory. 👉 How much would you pay to win? 👉 What’s the true cost of “insider info”? 👉 And when does ambition become corruption? This is classic Bad Guy Inc logic — a lesson in ethics, legality, and the fight game’s darker side. #ChaelSonnen #UFCHistory #SportsBetting #FightFixing #InsiderInformation #MMA #UFC #UFCScandal #CombatSports #Integrity Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7",
