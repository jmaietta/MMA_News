      "description": "Holy crap… Jake Paul just stepped into the MMA business. When the headline dropped that Ronda Rousey vs Gina Carano was happening in a cage, most people debated the matchup. That’s not the story. The story is Jake Paul teaming up with Netflix and putting on MMA. That’s a completely different conversation. Is he starting a promotion? Or is he in the “big fight business”? Because those are NOT the same thing. Chael breaks down: The difference between a sustainable MMA promotion and one-off superfights Why boxing and MMA clash on business models The real risk of building around a single main event Why Jake + Netflix could be very formidable And whether this is actually competition for the UFC You’re looking at Ronda vs Gina. Chael is looking at what happens next. Drop your take in the comments — is Jake building a promotion or just playing the big fight game? #MMA #JakePaul #UFC #RondaRousey #NetflixBad 0:00 – Jake Paul Is in the MMA Business?! 0:23 – Ronda Rousey vs Gina Carano… Wait, What? 0:58 – The Story Everyone Is Missing 1:07 – Cage + Netflix = Something Bigger 1:30 – Promotion vs Big Fight Business (Huge Difference) 2:09 – Is Jake Building a Real MMA Promotion? 2:53 – MVP + Netflix Is Formidable 3:02 – Does the Match Even Matter? 3:36 – Jake Paul vs Mike Tyson Broke the Internet 4:01 – The Risk of a One-Fight Card 4:27 – This Is the REAL Headline Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Jon Jones says he’s back. But was he ever really gone? And more importantly — who walked away from who? Jon Jones retired. Then eight days later, he un-retired. He offered himself for the White House card. He said the UFC could count on him. Then suddenly, we hear about a serious hip issue, arthritis, and even a potential hip replacement — with the detail that “the UFC knows all about it.” But here’s the problem: days later, Jon is playing full-speed flag football and holding pads while absorbing leg kicks from Olympic heavyweight Gable Steveson. So what’s the story? Is Jon hurt? Is the UFC hesitant? Or did Jon get the signal that the company wasn’t coming back to him — and decide to control the narrative? This isn’t an attack on Jon. It’s an attempt to reconcile the timeline. From the Tom Aspinall super fight, to the White House card rumors, to the hip explanation — something doesn’t quite line up. Let’s break it down.

      "description": "Paddy Pimblett reportedly weighed 190 pounds on fight night — after weighing in at 155. That’s not a weight cut. That’s a lifestyle. Commissions rarely step in and tell a fighter they’re pulling too much weight. If that conversation happened, it’s serious. Nothing retires a fighter faster than the scale. Ilia Topuria moved up. Conor McGregor refused to go back down. Islam Makhachev went up and won easier than he did at 155. The myth that moving up ruins you is false. Paddy at 170? Imagine the matchups: Ian Garry. Colby Covington. Even Conor. The ceiling is higher. The scale isn’t draining him. And his star power doesn’t depend on 155. At some point, fighters don’t retire because they lose — they retire because they’re tired of beating the scale. Let’s break down why it’s time.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6Aiz_hugvw",
      "description": "Let me explain why Jon Jones and Conor McGregor don’t make sense for the White House card. This isn’t about star power. This isn’t about legacy. This is about business. The White House card isn’t a pay-per-view. It’s reportedly tied to a fixed broadcast deal — meaning there’s no upside in paying the most expensive fighters on the roster unless they can help build something long term. And that’s the key. The location is the hook. Just like when the UFC went to the Sphere in Las Vegas, the venue is the star. The goal isn’t nostalgia — it’s exposure. It’s about converting brand-new eyeballs into future fans. But you can’t build the future around fighters who may never fight again. Jon has hinted the White House is “special.” Conor is unpredictable. Neither one is guaranteed to fight twice more — maybe not even once. Dana White doesn’t book closure. He books continuation. This card is about what’s next — not what was. #ConorMcGregor #JonJones #UFC #WhiteHouseCard #DanaWhite #MMA 00:00 – Why Jon & Conor Don’t Fit 00:12 – The Fixed Revenue Problem 00:42 – The White House Is the Star 01:20 – You Can’t Showcase Someone You Can’t Reuse 02:05 – Jon’s “White House Only” Signal 02:35 – The Promotion Tour Reality 03:05 – Tom Brady’s “Nobody Cares” Truth 04:10 – Dana Doesn’t Book Closure 05:05 – Why Retirement Fights Won’t Happen 06:00 – The Conor Air-Suck Problem 06:45 – This Card Is About the Future 07:10 – My Prediction: Neither Fights Again Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Plus, hear Askren's WILD THEORY on what the fight card should look like! DC and Askren also discuss Cain Velasquez's release from prison, Floyd Mayweather vs. Mike Tyson, as well as the problems with the UFC's heavyweight division and why it needs guys like Francis Ngannou, Ciryl Gane, and Tom Aspinall to be more active.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5gZABoH7_XA",
      "description": "The conversation around Tom Aspinall and his eye injury raises a brutal reality about elite fighting: once medical information is public, everything changes. There’s a huge difference between being hurt and proving you’re hurt. Fighters don’t owe fans medical records, but once details are revealed, it creates real consequences. If an injury is disclosed publicly, it becomes almost impossible to book a fight. Athletic commissions have to protect fighters first. Even if a matchup is announced, clearance becomes a major hurdle. That’s the risk every fighter faces when talking about injuries — especially champions or top contenders inside the Ultimate Fighting Championship. This isn’t about questioning toughness. It’s about how the system works. If a fighter doesn’t want to compete, announcing an injury guarantees time off. But if a fighter does want to compete, revealing too much can slow their career, delay paydays, and stall division movement. The bigger takeaway is how careful fighters have to be with information. At the championship level, timing, health, and perception all matter. And once something becomes official medically, it’s no longer just about willingness — it’s about clearance. For heavyweights especially, one delay can shift the entire division.

      "description": "The situation around Tom Aspinall may be more complicated than fans realize — especially if talks about him vacating even begin. If anyone is expected to get patience and grace from the promotion, it’s likely him. He fought through brutal adversity to reach the top, and questions still exist about damage caused by a technique many argue shouldn’t have been allowed in the first place. At the same time, real momentum is building behind the idea of Alex Pereira potentially appearing at heavyweight, possibly even tied to an event connected to the White House. But that creates a historic problem. There’s almost no precedent for a sitting champion moving divisions, staying champion, and fighting a non-title heavyweight bout. That’s where names like Ciryl Gane get complicated. If Pereira fights a top heavyweight contender, it’s very hard not to attach championship stakes. That’s why interim title talk starts creeping in — especially in a division controlled by the matchmaking realities of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. If this plays out, it could reshape two divisions at once. And historically, situations like this almost always end with belts moving.

      "description": "Alex Pereira may need to vacate his belt… but Tom Aspinall isn’t going to make that easy. There’s a growing theory that Pereira could move to heavyweight — possibly for the White House mega-card. And if he does, history tells us one thing: champions don’t change divisions for non-title fights. If Pereira goes up, it’s for gold. So what happens to Tom? Reports surfaced claiming Aspinall was asked to vacate. Some called it a troll account. But in MMA, stories rarely appear out of thin air. There’s usually smoke. The real question isn’t whether Tom gets stripped — it’s whether the UFC creates an interim heavyweight belt to set up something bigger. Pereira vs Ciryl Gane? An undisputed unification later? There’s leverage here. There’s timing here. And there’s only so many title fights you can stack on a White House card before reality sets in. Let’s break down what’s possible, what’s politics, and what makes business sense.

      "description": "Description (SEO-optimized, high-retention, ~180–240 words) Is Ilia Topuria really as good as the hype — or are we all getting carried away? When you ask fighters who actually understand the sport at the highest level, the answer gets very clear, very fast. Top names like Chris Weidman, Dustin Poirier, Laura Sanko, Dean Thomas, Aljamain Sterling, and Michael Chandler were all asked the same thing: Have we seen enough? The response was unanimous — yes. Yes, he caught Alexander Volkanovski with power. Yes, he finished Charles Oliveira early. But the bigger takeaway is consistency, confidence, and composure under pressure. Even with elite contenders like Arman Tsarukyan sitting cageside and watching the division shift, there’s growing belief that Topuria is operating at a different level right now. The real question isn’t power — it’s sustainability. Can he do it for 20+ minutes? Can anyone drag him somewhere uncomfortable? So far, inside the Ultimate Fighting Championship, nobody has shown a complete skill set that clearly breaks him.

      "description": "The story around Tom Aspinall may have just completely flipped. What once looked like weakness now looks like real damage — and maybe a misunderstanding that went way too far. New images showing Aspinall undergoing double eye surgery change the entire conversation. At the time of the incident, there were loud narratives questioning toughness and suggesting he wanted out. But according to officials, no rule was technically broken during the sequence. The referee did not call a disqualification. Still, if damage was caused — intentional or not — the bigger question becomes competitive fairness. If a fighter is injured in a sequence that ends a fight, should the opponent automatically get a rematch opportunity? That debate is now front and center around the heavyweight division and the matchmaking decisions inside the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The conversation also circles back to how quickly fans judge fighters at the elite level. Heavyweight margins are razor thin. One moment can change a career, a title run, or public perception. If anything, this situation reinforces how brutal championship MMA really is — and how fast narratives can age badly. If the division moves forward with potential rematches or new challengers like Ciryl Gane in the mix, the stakes only get bigger. But right now, the biggest shift is simple: the idea that Aspinall quit is getting harder and harder to defend.

From Tom Aspinall’s injury questions to Gable Steveson’s potential debut, to why light heavyweights like Aleksandar Rakić should seriously consider moving up — this episode of Ask Uncle Chael tackles the myth surrounding heavyweight. Here’s the uncomfortable truth: the bigger you go, the easier it gets. We’ve seen it before. Randy Couture. Daniel Cormier. Mark Coleman. Even Alex Pereira could realistically capture a heavyweight title if he moves up. The idea that heavyweight is the “hardest” division is perception — not reality. There’s less depth. Less iron-on-iron. More opportunity. And if that offends you, good.

      "description": "Ian Machado Garry might get the next title shot against Islam Makhachev — at least according to Michael Bisping. But is this real momentum… or just a slow news cycle? Garry’s résumé is strong. He pushed Shavkat Rakhmonov to the limit, beat former champion Belal Muhammad, and handled rising contenders like Carlos Prates and Geoff Neal. You can’t deny his trajectory. His stock rose even in defeat. But here’s the real question: if Garry isn’t next, then who is? There’s Michael Morales, who may or may not have been told he’s next after Madison Square Garden. There’s Kamaru Usman, who silenced doubts about his knees and reminded everyone what championship-level looks like. Stylistically, Usman vs Islam makes immediate sense. Yet no one at 170 is aggressively calling for Islam. And that’s the real issue. In a division short on star power, Garry and Colby Covington are the only true headline-makers. Garry is still improving — an outlier in a sport where most veterans plateau. If you don’t give Garry the shot now, where do you put him?

And when a former champion resurfaces after being oddly quiet, this is the moment to control the narrative. Instead, DDP used words like “obviously” and “like I said” — and neither helps his position. There is nothing obvious about wanting to fight Chimaev. If anything, the optics say the opposite. More importantly, there’s no realistic scenario where the UFC books Dricus vs Chimaev next. DDP built his career by steering the ship. He demanded main card placement over Bo Nickal. He parlayed momentum into Robert Whittaker. Then into Sean Strickland. Then into a championship. That wasn’t luck. That was strategy. Right now, Dricus is in the most dangerous position in MMA — contender without a plan. If you don’t call your shot, the UFC will call it for you. And you won’t like their version as much as your own.

If Chimaev fights next, it should be Nassourdine Imavov — unless the winner of Sean Strickland vs Brendan “Fluffy” Hernandez jumps the line. Strickland talks, Chimaev dominates, and Dricus Du Plessis needs to defend the UFC middleweight title soon.

Alex Pereira is already a two division champion, former middleweight champion and light heavyweight champion. With Tom Aspinall recovering and Jon Jones likely retired, the UFC heavyweight title picture is wide open. If Tom Aspinall is sidelined, Alex Pereira vs Ciryl Gane for an interim UFC heavyweight title makes sense. Alex Pereira chasing a third belt would be historic.

      "description": "Tom Aspinall has reportedly been asked to vacate the UFC heavyweight championship — but is there truth behind the rumor? After a claim surfaced online and was later labeled a troll post, the story gained traction when Josh Thomson discussed it publicly. Now the bigger question isn’t whether Tom is being stripped… it’s whether the White House card changes everything. If Alex Pereira moves to heavyweight, does he fight Ciryl Gane? And if so, is there a belt attached? History tells us one thing: sitting UFC champions do not change weight classes unless a championship is on the line. Never just for “a fight.” That opens the door to a potential interim heavyweight title — not as punishment to Aspinall, but as a way to keep the division moving while Tom heals from an injury suffered inside the cage under illegal circumstances. With Pereira openly discussing heavyweight and never mentioning a light heavyweight defense, speculation is rising fast. The clock is ticking on White House announcements. #UFC #TomAspinall #AlexPereira #Heavyweight #whitehousecard 0:00 Aspinall Vacate Rumor Explained 1:25 Pereira to Heavyweight? 2:40 Why an Interim Belt Makes Sense 4:05 The White House Card Clue 5:40 What This Means for Tom Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "There’s real smoke right now around a potential super card — and if this comes together, it’s built around activity, star power, and guaranteed violence. The most likely headliner? Ilia Topuria vs Justin Gaethje. That’s action you can sell globally. Pressure vs precision. Durability vs finishing instinct. It feels like the kind of fight that headlines itself. Then you start stacking the card… If he’s unbooked, it’s very easy to imagine Alex Pereira getting placed in a co-main or feature spot. Few fighters bring instant main-event gravity the way he does. The guy I’m most confident shows up on this type of card? Michael Chandler. Activity matters. Readiness matters. Chandler has built a reputation on both. Very strong chance you also see Sean O'Malley somewhere on the lineup. He moves numbers. He brings eyeballs. That matters for cards like this. There’s also noise around Colby Covington vs Bo Nickal. If that gets announced, it instantly becomes one of the most talked-about fights on the entire event. As for Conor McGregor… momentum feels slower. Not impossible. Just not something you build a card around right now. But if you walk out of a meeting with Topuria headlining and Pereira on the same card under the Ultimate Fighting Championship banner… that’s a statement event. That’s the kind of card fans remember. #UFC #MMA #IliaTopuria #JustinGaethje #AlexPereira #MichaelChandler #SeanOMalley #ColbyCovington #BoNickal #ConorMcGregor",
