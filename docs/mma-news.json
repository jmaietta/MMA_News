      "description": "Francis Ngannou just stunned the combat sports world by saying “no” to Anthony Joshua — and yes, this was a $10 million opportunity to headline against one of boxing’s biggest faces. It’s the kind of decision that leaves fans scratching their heads. In this clip, Chael Sonnen breaks down the bizarre situation: Ngannou, after two years of limited opportunities in the boxing world, was offered the main event spot against Joshua — a fight many called the ultimate “money fight.” But he turned it down. Sonnen walks through why this decision is so surprising, how it affects Ngannou’s career trajectory, and what it says about his mindset heading into future fights. You’ll get insider perspective on why a fighter would reject the biggest payday of their career, the potential consequences in the boxing and MMA crossover world, and how this moment shapes both Ngannou and Joshua’s legacies. If you’re a fan of combat sports, this breakdown is essential viewing. Don’t miss Chael’s sharp, no-nonsense take on one of the strangest calls in recent boxing history. Watch, learn, and join the discussion.",

      "description": "Dana White just dropped a bombshell – Paddy “The Baddy” Pimblett vs Justin Gaethje for the interim lightweight title, headlining the UFC’s first big card of 2026 on Paramount/CBS in Los Angeles! Ilia Topuria is stepping away to deal with personal issues, so the winner of Paddy vs Gaethje will fight him when he returns – and Arman Tsarukyan is lurking in the wings for his shot too. On top of that, Amanda Nunes returns from retirement to face Kayla Harrison, Sean O’Malley vs Song Yadong, Arnold Allen vs Jean Silva, Umar Nurmagomedov vs Deiveson Figueiredo, and Waldo Cortes-Acosta vs Derrick Lewis in a heavyweight banger. In this video I break down the entire card, what’s really going on with Ilia, how Paddy matches up with Gaethje.

Should the UFC pull the trigger on rising star Ian Garry, who looks destined for a title shot but maybe not next? What about Michael Morales, undefeated with 19 straight wins but still lacking the massive fan demand? And then there's Shavkat Rakhmonov — the guy nobody wants to fight, and the one name Chael admits he can’t answer when it comes to how badly each side wants it.

Celebrate their God-given power with the ultimate recognition for their dangerous hands. Save 20% today with promo code CHAEL and make this holiday unforgettable. ➡️ https://registeryourhands.com Youth wrestling has always been intense… but what Chael Sonnen witnessed pushed him past his breaking point. This isn’t discipline. This isn’t toughness. This is a line that parents should never cross — and Chael finally says what everyone’s afraid to say. In this clip, Chael breaks down a real situation he saw firsthand: a father forcing his eight-year-old daughter from 58 pounds down to 50 pounds just to get an edge at a tournament in Tulsa. Chael dives into the culture behind youth wrestling weight cuts, why these ideas never come from the kids, and how often it’s “dumb dad” pushing dangerous habits from the sidelines. He explains what cutting weight actually takes, why starving kids doesn’t create champions, and how the rulebook itself proves the better wrestler wins — not the lighter, hungrier one. Chael also pulls back the curtain on years of coaching, raising athletes, and watching parents chase shortcuts instead of building skills. This is raw, honest, and uncomfortable… and that’s exactly why it needs to be said. If you care about wrestling, youth sports, coaching, or parenting, this is a must-watch. It might just save a kid from being pushed in the wrong direction. 👉 Subscribe for more wrestling breakdowns, coaching insights, and daily commentary from Chael. #youthwrestling #wrestling #chaelsonnen #wrestlingparents #mma #sportsparenting #wrestlingculture #coachingBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Cormier says that despite the attention and hype that Paddy Pimblett has gotten as the next challenge, it is Arman who deserves and ultimately will get the next shot at the title.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU3CB7h_oT0",
      "description": "Islam Makhachev just poured cold water on the idea that Shavkat Rakhmonov deserves an immediate title shot — and he did it in classic champion fashion. Islam wasn’t disrespectful, but he was honest: returning from a one-year injury layoff doesn’t automatically punch your ticket to a world championship fight. In this clip, Chael Sonnen breaks down Islam’s stance and compares it to the history of fighters like Jon Jones, Dominick Cruz, and Jiri Prochazka. Some champions get grace and walk straight into title fights after long layoffs… others don’t. So where does an undefeated, 19-0 finisher like Shavkat actually land in that equation? Chael dives into Shavkat’s résumé — 19 wins, 18 finishes, only one career round lost — and explains why even with those stats, the timing, matchmaking, and political momentum of the 170-pound division might still favor someone else. Whether it’s Jack Della Maddalena, Belal Muhammad, Kamaru Usman, or someone unexpected, the welterweight contenders need one thing: to call a name, not a ranking. If Shavkat wants Islam, Chael argues, he needs to step forward, speak up, and get the mandate of the masses behind him. Until then, the division stays wide open. 👉 If you enjoy deep-dive fight analysis, hit subscribe for more breakdowns, rivalries, and UFC storylines every day. #IslamMakhachev #ShavkatRakhmonov #UFC #UFCTitle #Welterweight #MMA #ChaelSonnen Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

The matchups are great, the opportunities are huge, and the division is wide open… yet something just doesn’t add up. In today’s breakdown, Chael digs into why Islam’s move to welterweight hasn’t clicked the way fans expected. Chael explains how momentum, timing, matchmaking politics, and the emotional swings of the MMA community all play into this strange moment for Islam. You’ll also hear why Kamaru Usman isn’t pushing hard enough, why Ian Garry’s title shot feels inevitable but unclear, why Michael Morales may have just broken the rankings system, and why Shavkat Rakhmonov might be the missing piece that restores order to welterweight. With so many moving parts, the division is chaotic — and Islam feels oddly disconnected from all of it. If you want a real look at the business, the psychology, and the unwritten rules behind matchmaking, this is the insight you won’t get anywhere else.

      "description": "Is Jake Paul brave, or is he stupid? Those are the only two choices people seem willing to offer — but Chael Sonnen argues the truth is more complicated. Because before you judge Jake stepping in with Anthony Joshua, you have to answer one question nobody else is even asking: What is a win? Chael breaks it all down using his own experience from Metamoris, where simply surviving the time limit counted as a victory. And that’s the framework he applies to Jake vs Joshua: moral wins, measurable wins, and the tiny battles inside the bigger war. If Francis Ngannou was dropped every round he lasted, what happens if Jake simply lasts longer? What if he sees a stool between rounds? What if he lands one clean punch Francis couldn’t? What if he makes it to round four? These might not be traditional victories… but they’re real. Chael also lays out why the public often misunderstands boxing entirely — nobody boxed in high school, nobody had a boxing team in college, nobody even knows a boxer. So fans form expectations without understanding what actually happens in a ring. And with that gap, the “rules” of this matchup become unclear. So is Jake brave or stupid? Before you answer, you’ve got to define the criteria. Chael lays out his: time, rounds, survival, pressure, and moments. 📺 Stick around for more breakdowns, more logic, and more truth you’re not hearing anywhere else. #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #ChaelSonnen #Boxing Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "There’s something off inside the fight world right now, and Chael Sonnen is finally saying the part nobody else has the courage—or the clarity—to say. It starts with Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua, the most lopsided matchup in modern combat sports, and that’s coming from the guy who once said Francis Ngannou vs. Tyson Fury was unwinnable. But this time, something’s missing, and Chael can’t shake it. Then the feeling spreads. Khamzat Chimaev shows up in a corner at UFC events, and suddenly it hits Chael: Why does the undefeated wrecking machine of the middleweight division not have an opponent? Why is every 185-pound contender staying quiet? Why isn’t Bo Nickal pushing harder? Why is the UFC floating Dricus Du Plessis vs. Sean Strickland while leaving Chimaev in limbo? Something’s off. Then it moves to Arman Tsarukyan, Dan Hooker, and the promise that the winner “fights for the world championship next.” Except somehow, that didn’t happen either. And just when things seemed clear, Islam Makhachev starts engaging with Ian Garry online—a matchup that makes promotional sense, but not competitive sense. Meanwhile, Shavkat Rakhmonov has disappeared from public conversation entirely. Chael breaks down the real problem: The UFC is starting and stopping storylines across divisions, leaving contenders without direction, champions without dance partners, and fans without the connective tissue that usually holds the sport together. Nothing is lining up the way it should, and the silence from the UFC only makes it stranger. If you’ve felt like the UFC matchmaking puzzle isn’t fitting together… you’re not imagining it. #️⃣ #UFC #ChaelSonnen #KhamzatChimaev #IslamMakhachev #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #MMABad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH0_M-2kuQQ",
      "description": "The dynamic between Jon Jones and Gable Steveson is getting stranger by the week, and Chael Sonnen is breaking down the part of the story nobody else is willing to touch. This isn’t just about a blue-chip prospect entering the UFC—this is about what happens when his rise collides with the shadow of the greatest talent the heavyweight division has ever seen. Gable Steveson has fought multiple times in a matter of weeks, and somehow he’s generating more viral attention than established UFC contenders like Ian Garry, Belal Muhammad, Volkan Oezdemir, or Dan Hooker. Chael explains why that never happens for a fighter outside the UFC—and why the UFC suddenly has a placement problem on its hands. If they fast-track Steveson, as expected, he’ll be 6–0 in under two years… which puts him directly on Jon Jones’s doorstep. Here’s where the story gets messy: Gable has publicly said he won’t fight Jon Jones. Jon has implied he’s nearing the end of the road. And the UFC loves a narrative—even if that narrative isn’t exactly true. Chael digs into the parallels with Khabib and Islam Makhachev, Daniel Cormier and Cain Velasquez, and the “we’re brothers, so we don’t fight” excuse champions use when the next guy in line might actually be better. Will Jon step aside? Will he drop back to 205? Or is this all promotional fog to cover the fact that Gable Steveson might run through the heavyweight division faster than anyone in history? Watch Chael break down the whole thing—no bias, no politics, just the truth. #️⃣ #JonJones #GableSteveson #UFC #ChaelSonnen #MMA Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1wyQb0P0wM",
      "description": "Jake Paul versus Anthony Joshua isn’t a work, and Chael Sonnen is here to shut down the single dumbest rumor floating around combat sports. Every week, a new wave of fans claims Jake Paul will “pull out the day of the fight”—and Chael breaks down exactly why that idea makes zero sense. In this breakdown, Sonnen dismantles the logic behind the conspiracy. Jake Paul isn’t just the fighter—he’s the promoter. MVP Promotions is footing the bill for the press conferences, media tours, marketing, and the entire event infrastructure. Chael walks viewers through the absurdity: Who would Jake even pull out to? Does he email himself? Text himself? Sit across from himself in a boardroom? Chael also dives into Tank Davis’ canceled involvement, the fallout on the promotion, and how MVP ended up eating the cost. He revisits past fighters who used pull-out scams for attention, comparing that playbook to why Jake’s situation is fundamentally different. Then there’s Joshua—an Olympic champion, a former unified heavyweight king, a guy who knocked down Francis Ngannou multiple times in minutes. With a size, skill, and experience gap this massive, the only real approach for Joshua is exactly what he said: “I’m going to break his face.” That’s how a real fighter talks, not someone playing along in a scripted “work.” Chael ties the whole thing together with clarity: this fight is real, the stakes are real, and the excuses fans throw around say more about them than the athletes. #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #Boxing #MVP #ChaelSonnen #CombatSports Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
