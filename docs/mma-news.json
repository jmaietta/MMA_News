      "description": "\"Overreaction Time\" (Tuesdays, noon ET) is a weekly podcast hosted by MMA Junkie managing editor Simon Samano where he shares his \"overreactions\" with an MMA Junkie staff member, and the debate begins! On this edition, he and MMA Junkie reporter Danny Segura discuss the following: (00:00) - Intro (01:19) - We overestimated Reinier de Ridder, and his loss to Brendan Allen proved that he isn‚Äôt UFC champion material. (06:31) - UFC 321: Anything other than a dominant performance from Tom Aspinall would be disappointing. (11:13) - UFC 321: If Mackenzie Dern doesn‚Äôt win this vacant title, she‚Äôll officially be considered a bust. (15:58) - UFC 321: Nobody has more pressure to win than Umar Nurmagomedov. (21:45) - Khamzat Chimaev doesn't deserve to challenge Alex Pereira for the light heavyweight title. (24:28) - Sean Brady got screwed over by the UFC.
