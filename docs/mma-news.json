      "description": "Merab Dvalishvili fought his heart out — and Chael Sonnen gives him full credit for it. Merab never backed down, mixed counter wrestling with relentless pressure, and showed a disciplined, fundamentals-first striking game. But at the championship level, effort alone isn’t enough. Chael breaks down why Petr Yan won the fight. Yan’s ability to blend striking and grappling forced Merab to fight everywhere at once. The threat of Yan’s takedown changed the entire striking dynamic — jabs and crosses land differently when your opponent has to worry about sprawling. That’s why Merab’s striking has looked better lately, and it’s also why Yan was able to neutralize it. This wasn’t about who the better striker was. It wasn’t about who the better wrestler was. As Chael explains, when you get to main events and world championship fights, the question becomes simple: who is the better mixed martial artist? On this night, it was Petr Yan. His ability to blend offense, defense, pressure, and discipline made the difference — and that’s what separates elite contenders from champions. If you’re looking for high-level MMA analysis on Merab Dvalishvili, Petr Yan, and championship-level fighting, this breakdown delivers exactly that.",

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL ! #bruntpoChaelBad The PFL says they’re working on “something special” for Francis Ngannou — but what does that actually mean? According to a recent article, the plan appears to hinge on Vadim Nemkov winning his upcoming fight. If Nemkov wins, the idea is that then something special happens for Francis. Chael Sonnen reads the statement four times and comes away with the same question you probably have: why does this need to wait? Chael breaks down why Francis Ngannou vs Nemkov could be made right now, why the matchup works regardless of Nemkov’s result, and why calling this scenario “special” feels misleading. These are two heavyweights under the same banner, in the same division, in a promotion that exists to put on cage fights — so where’s the surprise? Chael also explains why the outcome of Nemkov vs Ferreira shouldn’t determine Francis’s future, why Nemkov coming off a loss may actually complicate the story, and why fans have been asking for this fight since Nemkov left light heavyweight. The fight itself? Chael likes it. He hopes it happens. But calling it special sets expectations — and Chael isn’t sure those expectations are being met. So the real question becomes: What part of this plan is supposed to excite us? #FrancisNgannou #PFL #ChaelSonnen #MMA #Nemkov #MMATalk #Heavyweight #FightBusiness Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChaelBadBad Arman Tsarukyan was supposed to be next. So why does it feel like he’s still standing outside the title picture looking in? After missing a scheduled main event under circumstances the public never fully understood, questions started swirling about whether Tsarukyan quietly lost his place in line. Now, with Dana White saying there are “things we don’t talk about” and that Arman “knows what it is,” the conversation has been reignited. Chael Sonnen breaks down the full timeline—from the late-night call that scrapped the fight, to Arman being named backup fighter, to his win over Dan Hooker in what was publicly labeled a number-one contender bout. Chael explains why being a backup is usually a golden ticket, why history suggests the next fight should have been for the belt, and why this situation is more complicated than people want to admit. Is Tsarukyan actually being punished? Or is this just the reality of timing, interim titles, and a crowded lightweight division with names like Justin Gaethje, Paddy Pimblett, and Ilia Topuria in the mix? Chael also explains why staying active through grappling matches may be the smartest move Arman can make—and why, if the jury were up to him, Tsarukyan has already done enough to be back in the title conversation. #ArmanTsarukyan #ChaelSonnen #UFC #LightweightDivision #DanaWhite #MMATalk ##UFCDebate Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChaelBad Everybody keeps saying the same thing about Khamzat Chimaev moving to 205: “He needs time. He needs to gain weight. He needs to get bigger.” And Chael Sonnen is here to tell you—none of that makes any sense. In this video, Chael breaks down why the idea of Chimaev needing to bulk up for light heavyweight is one of MMA’s most persistent and least examined myths. If Chimaev can beat a guy at 185, he can beat that same guy at 205. And if he can’t beat him at 185, adding ten pounds of bodyweight isn’t magically going to change the outcome. Chael goes through every example: Ilia Topuria moved up without bulking and finished his opponent. Islam Makhachev moved up without adding size and delivered one of the most dominant title-fight performances ever. In the real world, gaining weight doesn’t equal gaining advantage—it just means training less and eating more, which has never improved a fighter’s chances. Plus, nobody at heavyweight talks about who’s 40 pounds bigger. So why are fans obsessed with Chimaev being 10 pounds lighter at 205? Chael asks the only question that matters: When has “bulking up” ever helped anyone in a fight? #KhamzatChimaev #AlexPereira #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMA #LightHeavyweight #FightAnalysis #WeightClasses Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Chael Sonnen reacts to a brand-new argument about Ilia Topuria — the claim that he should have been stripped of his UFC title because he refused to fight without an illness or injury. Chael has never seen it from that angle, and he explains why he strongly disagrees. Ilia Topuria was ready to accept being stripped, but the UFC said no and instead moved forward with an interim title. For the first time, Chael hears someone say that was the wrong call. Should a champion keep the belt if he refuses to fight and it’s not due to injury? Is that fair in a “cult sport” like MMA? Chael breaks down the ethics, the optics, and the UFC’s reasoning.",

If you want to beat Justin Gaethje, you don’t need the better résumé, better grappling, or better conditioning — you need one thing: speed. Chael breaks down why every man who has ever beaten Gaethje shared that single trait, why Paddy’s age isn’t the advantage fans think it is, and why speed — not power, not wrestling — determines whether you survive the exchanges Gaethje allows you to have. Gaethje says his wrestling defense is second to none. Paddy says he’ll beat Justin on the feet. Chael says it comes down to one question: Is Paddy the Batty faster than Justin Gaethje… yes or no? #UFC #PaddyPimblett #JustinGaethje #ChaelSonnen #UFCLightweight #FightAnalysisBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Carlos Prates just called out Jack Della Maddalena — and Chael Sonnen wants to know the same thing you do: why? Is it fair game to call out a guy coming off a loss when that loss was for a world title? Chael says yes, absolutely… and then explains why fighters get this wrong all the time. Chael breaks down why card placement matters more than rankings, why calling up is always better than calling down, and why Prates targeting Jack actually makes complete career sense. He also ties in Brendan Allen calling out Dricus Du Plessis and how the middleweight and welterweight divisions are both wide open if you understand how the game really works. From Islam Makhachev’s options to Shavkat’s return, Ian Garry’s position, the rumors around Belal Muhammad, and whether Dana White promised Movsar a title shot — Chael walks through the whole 170 landscape and shows where Prates fits into it. But the real question is the one Chael wants Prates himself to answer: Why Jack? Is it the name? The position? A strategic play? Something personal? There’s no wrong answer — but Chael wants to hear it. #MMA #ChaelSonnen #UFCTalk #JackDella #CarlosPrates #UFC #Welterweight #FightBreakdownBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL ! #bruntpoChaelBad Chael Sonnen reacts to Francis Ngannou’s latest interview with Ariel Helwani, where Francis casually drops a loaded line: “They owe me one more fight.” Chael dives into what that really means, why that language bothers him, and whether Ngannou is basically hinting at a legal, contractual fight with the PFL instead of a physical one in the cage. Chael explains the idea of “going into business for yourself” — a pro wrestling term for when a performer goes off script live — and compares Francis’ comments about the UFC, Jon Jones, the White House card, and the PFL to that exact move. Ngannou is on a PFL platform talking about fighting in the UFC, talking about what he’s owed, and not doing much to push Nemkov, Ferreira, or anyone in his own promotion. From there, Chael breaks down why the attitude of “they owe me” completely misses the good-faith, handshake-spirit this sport usually runs on, especially after massive guarantees, carve-outs for boxing, and multi-million-dollar opportunities. And then he pitches the one matchup that actually makes sense right now: Francis Ngannou vs. Gable Steveson — big heavyweights, real credentials, and a fight that would actually move the needle. In Chael’s view, there’s one guy in MMA for Francis to fight.

      "description": "Jake Paul looks good, guys. New training footage just dropped of Jake on the heavy bag, and Chael breaks down why it actually matters more than people want to admit. Everyone loves to say, “Mitts and bag work don’t count,” but if you can compare old tape to new tape, you can see real changes in timing, speed, footwork, conditioning, and power. That’s all quantifiable. In this video, Chael explains why Jake Paul has multiple ways to “win” against Anthony Joshua that go beyond just getting his hand raised. Showing up, surviving rounds, slipping combinations, and simply being able to touch a world-class heavyweight boxer are all real milestones. Chael also lays out the uncomfortable truth: Jake’s power is not going to scare a 240-pound Olympic champion — so the game plan shouldn’t be “knock him out,” it should be “touch and move.” Using examples from George Foreman, Uriah Hall, Francis Ngannou, and Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather, Chael argues that Jake’s best chance is a high-volume, tagging approach, not loading up and planting. Based on this latest heavy bag session, Jake is checking the right boxes. More analysis on Joshua vs Paul is coming, but for now: Jake has never looked better. #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #Boxing #ChaelSonnen #FightBreakdown #TrainingFootage Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0fYCTe_LmU",
      "description": "Khamzat Chimaev says he’s open to anyone — Sean Strickland, Nassourdine Imavov, Paulo Costa, even moving up to 205 to fight Alex Pereira — yet somehow he still has no opponent. That’s the part Chael Sonnen can’t figure out, and it’s the central question of this breakdown: How does a star like Chimaev not know who he’s fighting next? Chael walks through the entire middleweight landscape: canceled matchups, replacements, and the domino effect that’s taken names like Fluffy Hernandez, Brendan Allen, and Roman Dolidze off the board. With Strickland booked, Fluffy now fighting Strickland, and Brendan Allen fresh off a win, the process of elimination points directly to Imavov. Yet Chimaev insists he doesn’t know and even downplays the idea by saying they've trained together and share cultural ties — something that cools the matchup rather than heats it up. Chael breaks down why that stance creates promotional obstacles, why fighters normally have a much clearer picture behind the scenes, and why it’s surprising that months after the Dricus du Plessis fight, Chimaev is still floating in uncertainty. If he truly wants Pereira at 205, that’s another layer entirely — Pereira’s situation at light heavyweight is just as quiet. This is one of the rare times Chael sees a top contender completely in the dark about his next assignment, and that alone is a story.

That’s the question Chael Sonnen takes a scalpel to in this video. Chael revisits Joe Rogan calling it a “travesty” if Jon Jones isn’t on the White House card, then presses the follow-up nobody seems to ask: what kind of travesty are we talking about? Is it worse to not have the greatest fighter of all time on the show, or to close the biggest event ever without a world title in the final slot? He examines the new era of matchmaking where an interim title fight like Gaethje vs Pimblett can headline over an undisputed women’s championship, and applies that same logic to Jones–Pereira versus Aspinall–Gane. On top of that, Chael points out the uncomfortable detail everyone ignores: Jon Jones isn’t even ranked in the top 15 right now. How does a non-title bout between an unranked fighter and a champion at another weight fit above every belt on the card? This isn’t just about names on a poster — it’s about star power, card hierarchy, and what the UFC wants the world to see last on the biggest stage it’s ever had.

But what complicates the scoring even more is Daniel Cormier’s cageside observation: Merab yelled out in pain multiple times after body shots from Yan. Under MMA rules, a verbal cry of pain can count as a submission, and it doesn’t require a hold, a choke, or even physical contact at the moment it’s uttered. So why wasn’t the fight stopped? Chael also revisits historical precedents, including Matt Hughes calling “timeout” mid-fight and athletes in PFL losing contests due to injury stoppages they didn’t intend. With fence grabs, unanswered questions in the officiating, and a debate about whether the fight should lead into a trilogy, this matchup raises serious issues about consistency in MMA rules and enforcement. Whether you scored it for Yan, for Merab, or saw it as a razor-thin technical fight, one thing is clear: multiple key moments in this bout deserve a closer look.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xs5z56zDqAQ",
      "description": "Daniel Cormier IS BACK to talk about the biggest headlines in the UFC and MMA, and there is NO BIGGER HEADLINE than Justin Gaethje fighting Paddy Pimblett at UFC 326, which leaves Arman Tsarukyan out of the picture. DC addresses the decision to go with Gaethje vs. Paddy, and why he doubles down on saying it's CRAZY that Arman is being left out of the championship spotlight. Cormier believes there is NOBODY more deserving of competing for a title, and that Tsarukyan has to stay active in the meantime. DC also sheds some light on the division's future with Ilia Topuria awaiting the winner of that interim title fight. Cormier wants to know from you the fans: Should Arman be fighting for the title? Or is Gaethje vs. Pimblett the right fight while Ilia is sidelined? Watch Jake Paul versus Anthony Joshua - Friday December 19th at 8 PM Eastern, 5 PM Pacific standard time. Live on Netflix.
