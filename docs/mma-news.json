Chael explains how McGregor is still in play through Max Holloway’s BMF belt, why Jon Jones and Alex Pereira could end up with title stakes depending on Tom Aspinall’s medical clearance, and how an interim or undisputed championship could emerge if Aspinall stays sidelined long enough. Trump’s “only title fights” comment sparked confusion, but Chael lays out the timeline, the logic, and the UFC’s options. Even if the information came “from the wrong hand,” Chael says the tool is correct — and the mega-title blueprint might already be in motion.",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PSnzLedU4I",
      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChaelBad Everybody keeps saying the same thing about Khamzat Chimaev moving to 205: “He needs time. He needs to gain weight. He needs to get bigger.” And Chael Sonnen is here to tell you—none of that makes any sense. In this video, Chael breaks down why the idea of Chimaev needing to bulk up for light heavyweight is one of MMA’s most persistent and least examined myths. If Chimaev can beat a guy at 185, he can beat that same guy at 205. And if he can’t beat him at 185, adding ten pounds of bodyweight isn’t magically going to change the outcome. Chael goes through every example: Ilia Topuria moved up without bulking and finished his opponent. Islam Makhachev moved up without adding size and delivered one of the most dominant title-fight performances ever. In the real world, gaining weight doesn’t equal gaining advantage—it just means training less and eating more, which has never improved a fighter’s chances. Plus, nobody at heavyweight talks about who’s 40 pounds bigger. So why are fans obsessed with Chimaev being 10 pounds lighter at 205? Chael asks the only question that matters: When has “bulking up” ever helped anyone in a fight? #KhamzatChimaev #AlexPereira #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMA #LightHeavyweight #FightAnalysis #WeightClasses Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Chael has never seen it from that angle, and he explains why he strongly disagrees. Ilia Topuria was ready to accept being stripped, but the UFC said no and instead moved forward with an interim title. For the first time, Chael hears someone say that was the wrong call. Should a champion keep the belt if he refuses to fight and it’s not due to injury? Is that fair in a “cult sport” like MMA? Chael breaks down the ethics, the optics, and the UFC’s reasoning.",

Is it fair game to call out a guy coming off a loss when that loss was for a world title? Chael says yes, absolutely… and then explains why fighters get this wrong all the time. Chael breaks down why card placement matters more than rankings, why calling up is always better than calling down, and why Prates targeting Jack actually makes complete career sense. He also ties in Brendan Allen calling out Dricus Du Plessis and how the middleweight and welterweight divisions are both wide open if you understand how the game really works. From Islam Makhachev’s options to Shavkat’s return, Ian Garry’s position, the rumors around Belal Muhammad, and whether Dana White promised Movsar a title shot — Chael walks through the whole 170 landscape and shows where Prates fits into it. But the real question is the one Chael wants Prates himself to answer: Why Jack? Is it the name? The position? A strategic play? Something personal? There’s no wrong answer — but Chael wants to hear it. #MMA #ChaelSonnen #UFCTalk #JackDella #CarlosPrates #UFC #Welterweight #FightBreakdownBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Chael explains the idea of “going into business for yourself” — a pro wrestling term for when a performer goes off script live — and compares Francis’ comments about the UFC, Jon Jones, the White House card, and the PFL to that exact move. Ngannou is on a PFL platform talking about fighting in the UFC, talking about what he’s owed, and not doing much to push Nemkov, Ferreira, or anyone in his own promotion. From there, Chael breaks down why the attitude of “they owe me” completely misses the good-faith, handshake-spirit this sport usually runs on, especially after massive guarantees, carve-outs for boxing, and multi-million-dollar opportunities. And then he pitches the one matchup that actually makes sense right now: Francis Ngannou vs. Gable Steveson — big heavyweights, real credentials, and a fight that would actually move the needle. In Chael’s view, there’s one guy in MMA for Francis to fight.

      "description": "Jake Paul looks good, guys. New training footage just dropped of Jake on the heavy bag, and Chael breaks down why it actually matters more than people want to admit. Everyone loves to say, “Mitts and bag work don’t count,” but if you can compare old tape to new tape, you can see real changes in timing, speed, footwork, conditioning, and power. That’s all quantifiable. In this video, Chael explains why Jake Paul has multiple ways to “win” against Anthony Joshua that go beyond just getting his hand raised. Showing up, surviving rounds, slipping combinations, and simply being able to touch a world-class heavyweight boxer are all real milestones. Chael also lays out the uncomfortable truth: Jake’s power is not going to scare a 240-pound Olympic champion — so the game plan shouldn’t be “knock him out,” it should be “touch and move.” Using examples from George Foreman, Uriah Hall, Francis Ngannou, and Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather, Chael argues that Jake’s best chance is a high-volume, tagging approach, not loading up and planting. Based on this latest heavy bag session, Jake is checking the right boxes. More analysis on Joshua vs Paul is coming, but for now: Jake has never looked better. #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #Boxing #ChaelSonnen #FightBreakdown #TrainingFootage Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Khamzat Chimaev says he’s open to anyone — Sean Strickland, Nassourdine Imavov, Paulo Costa, even moving up to 205 to fight Alex Pereira — yet somehow he still has no opponent. That’s the part Chael Sonnen can’t figure out, and it’s the central question of this breakdown: How does a star like Chimaev not know who he’s fighting next? Chael walks through the entire middleweight landscape: canceled matchups, replacements, and the domino effect that’s taken names like Fluffy Hernandez, Brendan Allen, and Roman Dolidze off the board. With Strickland booked, Fluffy now fighting Strickland, and Brendan Allen fresh off a win, the process of elimination points directly to Imavov. Yet Chimaev insists he doesn’t know and even downplays the idea by saying they've trained together and share cultural ties — something that cools the matchup rather than heats it up. Chael breaks down why that stance creates promotional obstacles, why fighters normally have a much clearer picture behind the scenes, and why it’s surprising that months after the Dricus du Plessis fight, Chimaev is still floating in uncertainty. If he truly wants Pereira at 205, that’s another layer entirely — Pereira’s situation at light heavyweight is just as quiet. This is one of the rare times Chael sees a top contender completely in the dark about his next assignment, and that alone is a story.

That’s the question Chael Sonnen takes a scalpel to in this video. Chael revisits Joe Rogan calling it a “travesty” if Jon Jones isn’t on the White House card, then presses the follow-up nobody seems to ask: what kind of travesty are we talking about? Is it worse to not have the greatest fighter of all time on the show, or to close the biggest event ever without a world title in the final slot? He examines the new era of matchmaking where an interim title fight like Gaethje vs Pimblett can headline over an undisputed women’s championship, and applies that same logic to Jones–Pereira versus Aspinall–Gane. On top of that, Chael points out the uncomfortable detail everyone ignores: Jon Jones isn’t even ranked in the top 15 right now. How does a non-title bout between an unranked fighter and a champion at another weight fit above every belt on the card? This isn’t just about names on a poster — it’s about star power, card hierarchy, and what the UFC wants the world to see last on the biggest stage it’s ever had.

But what complicates the scoring even more is Daniel Cormier’s cageside observation: Merab yelled out in pain multiple times after body shots from Yan. Under MMA rules, a verbal cry of pain can count as a submission, and it doesn’t require a hold, a choke, or even physical contact at the moment it’s uttered. So why wasn’t the fight stopped? Chael also revisits historical precedents, including Matt Hughes calling “timeout” mid-fight and athletes in PFL losing contests due to injury stoppages they didn’t intend. With fence grabs, unanswered questions in the officiating, and a debate about whether the fight should lead into a trilogy, this matchup raises serious issues about consistency in MMA rules and enforcement. Whether you scored it for Yan, for Merab, or saw it as a razor-thin technical fight, one thing is clear: multiple key moments in this bout deserve a closer look.

If there really are 11 fights and the main card is all title fights, it would reshape everything fans think they know about Conor McGregor, Jon Jones, and Alex Pereira. Chael lays out the three possibilities: Trump got a detail wrong, he got a detail right… or the entire thing is a supercard unlike anything the UFC has ever attempted.",

If Joshua Van beats Pantoja in the rematch, Chael believes fans will look at this first fight very differently. Van got it right four times — and that’s why he’s Chael’s Fighter of the Year.",

      "description": "Khamzat Chimaev keeps calling out Alex Pereira — again, and again, and again. And Chael Sonnen believes this isn’t just random matchmaking anymore. This feels personal. The challenge now is figuring out why. Chael breaks down the timeline of Chimaev’s callouts, starting back when Khamzat was still flirting with 170 and talking about becoming a champ-champ. Back then, calling out Pereira made competitive sense. But now that Chimaev has abandoned welterweight and even hinted at leaving middleweight, the continued fixation on Alex Pereira raises real questions. What’s driving it? Respect? Ambition? Something behind the scenes? A snub? Training history? A cultural wrinkle? Chael explores every possibility. Meanwhile, Pereira isn’t ignoring him. Poatan has responded multiple times — telling Khamzat he’s focused on Jon Jones but inviting him to 205 “if you can get here.” He even accepted the idea of a grappling match. That back-and-forth alone shows this matchup isn’t as far-fetched as people think. Chael then explains why Carlos Ulberg, despite owning the rankings argument, isn’t generating the momentum needed to secure a Pereira fight — and why that opens a lane for Chimaev if he stays loud and strategic. If Pereira–Jones doesn’t materialize, Pereira returning to 205 in need of a big fight suddenly makes Khamzat a very real option. This is how unexpected superfights get born — slowly, then all at once.

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChaelBadBad Rumors that Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua is “off,” are getting downright bizarre. Former heavyweight champion Bermane Stiverne claims he “heard somewhere” that Jake is injured, the fight is canceled, and a black eye from sparring shut the whole thing down. Chael breaks down why none of that adds up — starting with the simple fact that Jake Paul has no one to pull out from. He’s the one promoting the event. In this video, Chael dismantles the rumor piece by piece, from Stiverne’s shaky claims to the idea that a professional fighter would cancel a mega-fight over a black eye. He also draws a powerful comparison to Joshua Van, who walked into a fight nobody believed he could win — and did it anyway. That’s what separates real competitors from spectators who speculate. If you’re following the buildup to Joshua vs. Paul, or if you just want clarity on what’s real and what’s nonsense, this is the breakdown to watch. Chael dives into fighter mentality, hype cycles, and why some people simply don’t understand what it means to show up when the odds are stacked. Don’t fall for bad info. Here’s what’s actually happening.

Cormier believes there is NOBODY more deserving of competing for a title, and that Tsarukyan has to stay active in the meantime. DC also sheds some light on the division's future with Ilia Topuria awaiting the winner of that interim title fight. Cormier wants to know from you the fans: Should Arman be fighting for the title?

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChael 170 pounds is murderers’ row, and that’s exactly why Islam Makhachev needs Kamaru Usman. Not just for a payday, not just for a name – for legacy. Chael breaks down the current state of the UFC welterweight division, from killers like Michael Morales, Sean Brady, Ian Garry, Belal Muhammad, and Shavkat Rakhmonov, to what really makes sense next for Islam. On paper, you can argue a lot of contenders… but when you factor in history, greatness, and what actually moves the needle, one name keeps coming back: Kamaru Usman. Chael explains why giving Usman a title shot isn’t just “rewarding” him for a dominant career – it might actually be the best thing you can do for Islam. If Makhachev goes out and does to Usman what even Khamzat Chimaev couldn’t, that changes the GOAT and pound-for-pound conversations overnight. We also get into Georges St-Pierre, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and how Islam’s resume will age as guys like Arman Tsarukyan rise to the top. This is a cold sport, and matchmaking at this level is about more than rankings. It’s about legacy, star power, and who you beat when it matters.
