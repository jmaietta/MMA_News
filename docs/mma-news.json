      "description": "Carlos Prates just called out Jack Della Maddalena — and Chael Sonnen wants to know the same thing you do: why? Is it fair game to call out a guy coming off a loss when that loss was for a world title? Chael says yes, absolutely… and then explains why fighters get this wrong all the time. Chael breaks down why card placement matters more than rankings, why calling up is always better than calling down, and why Prates targeting Jack actually makes complete career sense. He also ties in Brendan Allen calling out Dricus Du Plessis and how the middleweight and welterweight divisions are both wide open if you understand how the game really works. From Islam Makhachev’s options to Shavkat’s return, Ian Garry’s position, the rumors around Belal Muhammad, and whether Dana White promised Movsar a title shot — Chael walks through the whole 170 landscape and shows where Prates fits into it. But the real question is the one Chael wants Prates himself to answer: Why Jack? Is it the name? The position? A strategic play? Something personal? There’s no wrong answer — but Chael wants to hear it. #MMA #ChaelSonnen #UFCTalk #JackDella #CarlosPrates #UFC #Welterweight #FightBreakdownBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL ! #bruntpoChaelBad Chael Sonnen reacts to Francis Ngannou’s latest interview with Ariel Helwani, where Francis casually drops a loaded line: “They owe me one more fight.” Chael dives into what that really means, why that language bothers him, and whether Ngannou is basically hinting at a legal, contractual fight with the PFL instead of a physical one in the cage. Chael explains the idea of “going into business for yourself” — a pro wrestling term for when a performer goes off script live — and compares Francis’ comments about the UFC, Jon Jones, the White House card, and the PFL to that exact move. Ngannou is on a PFL platform talking about fighting in the UFC, talking about what he’s owed, and not doing much to push Nemkov, Ferreira, or anyone in his own promotion. From there, Chael breaks down why the attitude of “they owe me” completely misses the good-faith, handshake-spirit this sport usually runs on, especially after massive guarantees, carve-outs for boxing, and multi-million-dollar opportunities. And then he pitches the one matchup that actually makes sense right now: Francis Ngannou vs. Gable Steveson — big heavyweights, real credentials, and a fight that would actually move the needle. In Chael’s view, there’s one guy in MMA for Francis to fight.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOtBMUI0JsE",
      "description": "Jake Paul looks good, guys. New training footage just dropped of Jake on the heavy bag, and Chael breaks down why it actually matters more than people want to admit. Everyone loves to say, “Mitts and bag work don’t count,” but if you can compare old tape to new tape, you can see real changes in timing, speed, footwork, conditioning, and power. That’s all quantifiable. In this video, Chael explains why Jake Paul has multiple ways to “win” against Anthony Joshua that go beyond just getting his hand raised. Showing up, surviving rounds, slipping combinations, and simply being able to touch a world-class heavyweight boxer are all real milestones. Chael also lays out the uncomfortable truth: Jake’s power is not going to scare a 240-pound Olympic champion — so the game plan shouldn’t be “knock him out,” it should be “touch and move.” Using examples from George Foreman, Uriah Hall, Francis Ngannou, and Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather, Chael argues that Jake’s best chance is a high-volume, tagging approach, not loading up and planting. Based on this latest heavy bag session, Jake is checking the right boxes. More analysis on Joshua vs Paul is coming, but for now: Jake has never looked better. #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #Boxing #ChaelSonnen #FightBreakdown #TrainingFootage Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0fYCTe_LmU",
      "description": "Khamzat Chimaev says he’s open to anyone — Sean Strickland, Nassourdine Imavov, Paulo Costa, even moving up to 205 to fight Alex Pereira — yet somehow he still has no opponent. That’s the part Chael Sonnen can’t figure out, and it’s the central question of this breakdown: How does a star like Chimaev not know who he’s fighting next? Chael walks through the entire middleweight landscape: canceled matchups, replacements, and the domino effect that’s taken names like Fluffy Hernandez, Brendan Allen, and Roman Dolidze off the board. With Strickland booked, Fluffy now fighting Strickland, and Brendan Allen fresh off a win, the process of elimination points directly to Imavov. Yet Chimaev insists he doesn’t know and even downplays the idea by saying they've trained together and share cultural ties — something that cools the matchup rather than heats it up. Chael breaks down why that stance creates promotional obstacles, why fighters normally have a much clearer picture behind the scenes, and why it’s surprising that months after the Dricus du Plessis fight, Chimaev is still floating in uncertainty. If he truly wants Pereira at 205, that’s another layer entirely — Pereira’s situation at light heavyweight is just as quiet. This is one of the rare times Chael sees a top contender completely in the dark about his next assignment, and that alone is a story.

Can she make a run to become world champion like she has always aspired to be?

That’s the question Chael Sonnen takes a scalpel to in this video. Chael revisits Joe Rogan calling it a “travesty” if Jon Jones isn’t on the White House card, then presses the follow-up nobody seems to ask: what kind of travesty are we talking about? Is it worse to not have the greatest fighter of all time on the show, or to close the biggest event ever without a world title in the final slot? He examines the new era of matchmaking where an interim title fight like Gaethje vs Pimblett can headline over an undisputed women’s championship, and applies that same logic to Jones–Pereira versus Aspinall–Gane. On top of that, Chael points out the uncomfortable detail everyone ignores: Jon Jones isn’t even ranked in the top 15 right now. How does a non-title bout between an unranked fighter and a champion at another weight fit above every belt on the card? This isn’t just about names on a poster — it’s about star power, card hierarchy, and what the UFC wants the world to see last on the biggest stage it’s ever had.

But what complicates the scoring even more is Daniel Cormier’s cageside observation: Merab yelled out in pain multiple times after body shots from Yan. Under MMA rules, a verbal cry of pain can count as a submission, and it doesn’t require a hold, a choke, or even physical contact at the moment it’s uttered. So why wasn’t the fight stopped? Chael also revisits historical precedents, including Matt Hughes calling “timeout” mid-fight and athletes in PFL losing contests due to injury stoppages they didn’t intend. With fence grabs, unanswered questions in the officiating, and a debate about whether the fight should lead into a trilogy, this matchup raises serious issues about consistency in MMA rules and enforcement. Whether you scored it for Yan, for Merab, or saw it as a razor-thin technical fight, one thing is clear: multiple key moments in this bout deserve a closer look.

      "description": "Khamzat Chimaev keeps calling out Alex Pereira — again, and again, and again. And Chael Sonnen believes this isn’t just random matchmaking anymore. This feels personal. The challenge now is figuring out why. Chael breaks down the timeline of Chimaev’s callouts, starting back when Khamzat was still flirting with 170 and talking about becoming a champ-champ. Back then, calling out Pereira made competitive sense. But now that Chimaev has abandoned welterweight and even hinted at leaving middleweight, the continued fixation on Alex Pereira raises real questions. What’s driving it? Respect? Ambition? Something behind the scenes? A snub? Training history? A cultural wrinkle? Chael explores every possibility. Meanwhile, Pereira isn’t ignoring him. Poatan has responded multiple times — telling Khamzat he’s focused on Jon Jones but inviting him to 205 “if you can get here.” He even accepted the idea of a grappling match. That back-and-forth alone shows this matchup isn’t as far-fetched as people think. Chael then explains why Carlos Ulberg, despite owning the rankings argument, isn’t generating the momentum needed to secure a Pereira fight — and why that opens a lane for Chimaev if he stays loud and strategic. If Pereira–Jones doesn’t materialize, Pereira returning to 205 in need of a big fight suddenly makes Khamzat a very real option. This is how unexpected superfights get born — slowly, then all at once.

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChaelBadBad Rumors that Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua is “off,” are getting downright bizarre. Former heavyweight champion Bermane Stiverne claims he “heard somewhere” that Jake is injured, the fight is canceled, and a black eye from sparring shut the whole thing down. Chael breaks down why none of that adds up — starting with the simple fact that Jake Paul has no one to pull out from. He’s the one promoting the event. In this video, Chael dismantles the rumor piece by piece, from Stiverne’s shaky claims to the idea that a professional fighter would cancel a mega-fight over a black eye. He also draws a powerful comparison to Joshua Van, who walked into a fight nobody believed he could win — and did it anyway. That’s what separates real competitors from spectators who speculate. If you’re following the buildup to Joshua vs. Paul, or if you just want clarity on what’s real and what’s nonsense, this is the breakdown to watch. Chael dives into fighter mentality, hype cycles, and why some people simply don’t understand what it means to show up when the odds are stacked. Don’t fall for bad info.

Not just for a payday, not just for a name – for legacy. Chael breaks down the current state of the UFC welterweight division, from killers like Michael Morales, Sean Brady, Ian Garry, Belal Muhammad, and Shavkat Rakhmonov, to what really makes sense next for Islam. On paper, you can argue a lot of contenders… but when you factor in history, greatness, and what actually moves the needle, one name keeps coming back: Kamaru Usman. Chael explains why giving Usman a title shot isn’t just “rewarding” him for a dominant career – it might actually be the best thing you can do for Islam. If Makhachev goes out and does to Usman what even Khamzat Chimaev couldn’t, that changes the GOAT and pound-for-pound conversations overnight. We also get into Georges St-Pierre, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and how Islam’s resume will age as guys like Arman Tsarukyan rise to the top. This is a cold sport, and matchmaking at this level is about more than rankings. It’s about legacy, star power, and who you beat when it matters.

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChaelBad President Donald Trump just dropped a bombshell about the rumored UFC White House card – and whether he nailed every detail or not, the theme of what he said is wild. He floated June 14th, talked about nine title fights, and even used the phrase “only title fights.” Now, maybe one of those details is off… but if even one of them is right, everything changes. Chael breaks down what an all-title-fight card (or even an all-title-fight main card) would really mean. If it’s “only title fights,” where does that leave all the rumors we’ve heard about Conor McGregor, Jon Jones vs. Alex Pereira, and the heavyweight picture around Tom Aspinall and Ciryl Gane? Chael walks through how you could still make Conor a title fight with Max Holloway’s BMF belt, how Jones–Pereira could slide into a championship scenario, and what happens if Aspinall stays on the shelf long enough to force an interim or undisputed shake-up. This isn’t just fantasy matchmaking; it’s trying to read between the lines of what the host of the event is saying. If Trump is talking nine title fights and “only title fights,” even if the numbers are fuzzy, the direction is clear: the UFC is aiming for something historically stacked. Where does this all land? We’ll see. But it sure sounds like we’re in for a night loaded with gold.

      "description": "Get 15% OFF The House of Atlas Razor Kit + Before and After Set with the code CHAEL at https://www.houseofatlas.com/CHAEL! #houseofatlaspod Should Ilia Topuria still be the champion? That’s the question circling the UFC offices right now, and it’s a lot colder — and a lot more complicated — than fans realize. I just walked out of the UFC Performance Institute in Las Vegas, and everybody has an opinion on Ilia Topuria. Some say he’s the best boxer in MMA, others say he’s the future face of the sport, maybe even headlining the White House card. But for the first time, a very respected voice hit me with a different argument entirely: Ilia should have been stripped. Not sidelined. Not given grace. Stripped. This person walked me through the history of the interim title — why it exists, when it’s used, and why illness or injury has always been the deciding factor. They brought up Dominick Cruz’s three-and-a-half-year layoff, ACL after ACL, and the compassion that kept him champion. Their claim? Ilia’s situation doesn’t fall under illness or injury… so why keep the belt? Now, I don’t agree. I believe Ilia Topuria has handled a tough situation with transparency and courage. He even told the UFC to move on without him if needed — a man’s move. But the question remains: Should a champion keep his title if he refuses to fight and it’s not due to injury? This is the cold side of a cold sport. And it’s worth discussing.

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChael Fighter of the Year isn’t a statistic. It’s an argument and Chael Sonnen isn’t afraid to make it. In this clip, Chael breaks down why he believes Joshua Van deserves serious consideration in the Fighter of the Year conversation — even while others point to Merab Dvalishvili’s year of title fights as the obvious pick. This isn’t a takedown of anyone. It’s a challenge to the way fans think about greatness. Chael compares championship moments, calendar-year performance, and consistency — explaining why “perfect” isn’t required to be dominant. Drawing from past debates and controversial picks, he shows how momentum, difficulty of opposition, and big moments matter just as much as undefeated records. The conversation also turns toward today’s hot topic: rematches. Chael explains why one future fight could completely change how the past is remembered — and why fans should be careful about rushing to judgment when careers are still being written. Whether you agree or disagree, this breakdown makes one thing clear: this isn’t about popularity. It’s about performance. If you love real fight debate, not clickbait, not hype but hard opinions backed by logic, this one is for you.

      "description": "Bare-knuckle wrestling is intense, but Chael Sonnen argues that blaming the gloves is a massive copout. In this clip, he explains why fighters must be held accountable for actions like eye pokes, grabbing the fence, or kicking opponents while down — regardless of whether gloves are involved. Chael points out that referees and fans often label these incidents “unintentional,” but that mindset ignores responsibility. Even without gloves, fighters can and should avoid fouls. The real issue isn’t the equipment — it’s accountability. If someone pokes an opponent in the eye, someone is at fault, plain and simple. This clip is essential for anyone following MMA rules, bare-knuckle combat, or fighter safety. Chael’s analysis highlights how leniency for “accidents” undermines fairness, sets poor precedents, and affects how fights are judged. He stresses that proper enforcement and accountability maintain the integrity of the sport, rather than blaming gloves or equipment. For fans of MMA, bare-knuckle fighting, fighter safety, and insider fight analysis, this breakdown delivers Chael Sonnen’s sharp and unfiltered perspective.",
