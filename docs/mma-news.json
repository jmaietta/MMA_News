      "description": "Something’s off with Islam Makhachev at 170 pounds — and Chael doesn't know exactly what it is. The matchups are great, the opportunities are huge, and the division is wide open… yet something just doesn’t add up. In today’s breakdown, Chael digs into why Islam’s move to welterweight hasn’t clicked the way fans expected. Chael explains how momentum, timing, matchmaking politics, and the emotional swings of the MMA community all play into this strange moment for Islam. You’ll also hear why Kamaru Usman isn’t pushing hard enough, why Ian Garry’s title shot feels inevitable but unclear, why Michael Morales may have just broken the rankings system, and why Shavkat Rakhmonov might be the missing piece that restores order to welterweight. With so many moving parts, the division is chaotic — and Islam feels oddly disconnected from all of it. If you want a real look at the business, the psychology, and the unwritten rules behind matchmaking, this is the insight you won’t get anywhere else.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_noRaAl0cNM",
      "description": "Is Jake Paul brave, or is he stupid? Those are the only two choices people seem willing to offer — but Chael Sonnen argues the truth is more complicated. Because before you judge Jake stepping in with Anthony Joshua, you have to answer one question nobody else is even asking: What is a win? Chael breaks it all down using his own experience from Metamoris, where simply surviving the time limit counted as a victory. And that’s the framework he applies to Jake vs Joshua: moral wins, measurable wins, and the tiny battles inside the bigger war. If Francis Ngannou was dropped every round he lasted, what happens if Jake simply lasts longer? What if he sees a stool between rounds? What if he lands one clean punch Francis couldn’t? What if he makes it to round four? These might not be traditional victories… but they’re real. Chael also lays out why the public often misunderstands boxing entirely — nobody boxed in high school, nobody had a boxing team in college, nobody even knows a boxer. So fans form expectations without understanding what actually happens in a ring. And with that gap, the “rules” of this matchup become unclear. So is Jake brave or stupid? Before you answer, you’ve got to define the criteria. Chael lays out his: time, rounds, survival, pressure, and moments. 📺 Stick around for more breakdowns, more logic, and more truth you’re not hearing anywhere else. #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #ChaelSonnen #Boxing Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "There’s something off inside the fight world right now, and Chael Sonnen is finally saying the part nobody else has the courage—or the clarity—to say. It starts with Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua, the most lopsided matchup in modern combat sports, and that’s coming from the guy who once said Francis Ngannou vs. Tyson Fury was unwinnable. But this time, something’s missing, and Chael can’t shake it. Then the feeling spreads. Khamzat Chimaev shows up in a corner at UFC events, and suddenly it hits Chael: Why does the undefeated wrecking machine of the middleweight division not have an opponent? Why is every 185-pound contender staying quiet? Why isn’t Bo Nickal pushing harder? Why is the UFC floating Dricus Du Plessis vs. Sean Strickland while leaving Chimaev in limbo? Something’s off. Then it moves to Arman Tsarukyan, Dan Hooker, and the promise that the winner “fights for the world championship next.” Except somehow, that didn’t happen either. And just when things seemed clear, Islam Makhachev starts engaging with Ian Garry online—a matchup that makes promotional sense, but not competitive sense. Meanwhile, Shavkat Rakhmonov has disappeared from public conversation entirely. Chael breaks down the real problem: The UFC is starting and stopping storylines across divisions, leaving contenders without direction, champions without dance partners, and fans without the connective tissue that usually holds the sport together. Nothing is lining up the way it should, and the silence from the UFC only makes it stranger. If you’ve felt like the UFC matchmaking puzzle isn’t fitting together… you’re not imagining it. #️⃣ #UFC #ChaelSonnen #KhamzatChimaev #IslamMakhachev #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #MMABad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "The dynamic between Jon Jones and Gable Steveson is getting stranger by the week, and Chael Sonnen is breaking down the part of the story nobody else is willing to touch. This isn’t just about a blue-chip prospect entering the UFC—this is about what happens when his rise collides with the shadow of the greatest talent the heavyweight division has ever seen. Gable Steveson has fought multiple times in a matter of weeks, and somehow he’s generating more viral attention than established UFC contenders like Ian Garry, Belal Muhammad, Volkan Oezdemir, or Dan Hooker. Chael explains why that never happens for a fighter outside the UFC—and why the UFC suddenly has a placement problem on its hands. If they fast-track Steveson, as expected, he’ll be 6–0 in under two years… which puts him directly on Jon Jones’s doorstep. Here’s where the story gets messy: Gable has publicly said he won’t fight Jon Jones. Jon has implied he’s nearing the end of the road. And the UFC loves a narrative—even if that narrative isn’t exactly true. Chael digs into the parallels with Khabib and Islam Makhachev, Daniel Cormier and Cain Velasquez, and the “we’re brothers, so we don’t fight” excuse champions use when the next guy in line might actually be better. Will Jon step aside? Will he drop back to 205? Or is this all promotional fog to cover the fact that Gable Steveson might run through the heavyweight division faster than anyone in history? Watch Chael break down the whole thing—no bias, no politics, just the truth. #️⃣ #JonJones #GableSteveson #UFC #ChaelSonnen #MMA Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Jake Paul versus Anthony Joshua isn’t a work, and Chael Sonnen is here to shut down the single dumbest rumor floating around combat sports. Every week, a new wave of fans claims Jake Paul will “pull out the day of the fight”—and Chael breaks down exactly why that idea makes zero sense. In this breakdown, Sonnen dismantles the logic behind the conspiracy. Jake Paul isn’t just the fighter—he’s the promoter. MVP Promotions is footing the bill for the press conferences, media tours, marketing, and the entire event infrastructure. Chael walks viewers through the absurdity: Who would Jake even pull out to? Does he email himself? Text himself? Sit across from himself in a boardroom? Chael also dives into Tank Davis’ canceled involvement, the fallout on the promotion, and how MVP ended up eating the cost. He revisits past fighters who used pull-out scams for attention, comparing that playbook to why Jake’s situation is fundamentally different. Then there’s Joshua—an Olympic champion, a former unified heavyweight king, a guy who knocked down Francis Ngannou multiple times in minutes. With a size, skill, and experience gap this massive, the only real approach for Joshua is exactly what he said: “I’m going to break his face.” That’s how a real fighter talks, not someone playing along in a scripted “work.” Chael ties the whole thing together with clarity: this fight is real, the stakes are real, and the excuses fans throw around say more about them than the athletes. #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #Boxing #MVP #ChaelSonnen #CombatSports Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

And if not Arman, then what else does Arman need to do to finally get a crack at the title?

There are a ton of contenders vying for the shot at the champion, so no better time for DC to break out his match-making skills. Then, ahead of WWE Survivor Series this Saturday, \"Dirty\" Dom Mysterio joins the show as he gets ready to seek revenge on John Cena. ✔ For more UFC, sign up for ESPN+ http://espnplus.com/ufc/youtube ✔ Get the ESPN App: http://www.espn.com/espn/apps/espn ✔ Subscribe to ESPN on YouTube: http://es.pn/SUBSCRIBEtoYOUTUBE ✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC ✔ Subscribe to NBA on ESPN on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoNBAonESPN ✔ Watch ESPN on YouTube TV: http://es.pn/YouTubeTV",

      "description": "Jake Paul stepping in against Anthony Joshua isn’t just surprising — it’s downright astonishing. This is one of those moments where you look around and ask, “Is anyone else seeing this?” Because whatever you think of Jake, this is a level of courage that demands attention. In this clip, I break down why Joshua is one of the most terrifying matchups anyone could say yes to, let alone a guy who was on Disney Channel ten years ago. Even Paul Felder, who has been openly critical of Jake Paul in the past, came out and said this move earned his respect. And he’s right — Joshua is a different kind of danger. Most fighters wouldn’t touch this opportunity with a ten-foot pole. Let’s be honest: 95% of fans are tuning in to watch Jake Paul get smashed, and Jake knows it. But that remaining 5% — the ones who actually believe he can pull off something special? I’m with them. I’m rolling with Jake. I want to see the kid do well. And if the matchup itself wasn’t crazy enough, Jake didn’t even give himself a full month of prep before traveling out for the fight. Three weeks. That’s it. That’s insanity… and commitment. If you want raw honesty, real breakdowns, and the truth about what this matchup means, this clip has it all. 👉 Stick around for more combat-sports analysis and straight talk.",

That’s the story Logan Paul is out here telling — and it’s wild enough that it deserves a real breakdown. In this clip, I dive into Logan’s claim that he went over Dana White’s head to pitch a Conor McGregor boxing match directly to Ari Emanuel. According to Logan, the fight was expected to generate a staggering half-billion-dollar purse, splitting $250 million each for him and Conor. It’s a massive number, an entertaining story… and a perfect setup for a reality check. I walk through why this fight never had a chance, what Logan misunderstands about the business of combat sports, and why bypassing the UFC president isn’t just bold — it’s borderline fantasy. Whether it’s boxing, golf, tennis, or thumb wrestling, no company on Earth is cutting a $250 million check for that matchup. And that’s not disrespect — that’s economics. If you want a straight, honest, no-nonsense take on what really goes into making the biggest fights in the world, this clip lays it out. It’s a look behind the curtain at the part of the fight game most fans never get to see. 👉 Watch more breakdowns, stories, and real talk from inside combat sports.",

      "description": "The UFC doesn’t build towards a superfight by accident — and right now, all signs point to Ilia Topuria and Islam Makhachev being the matchup they want headlining the rumored White House card. This is the kind of pairing the promotion clears the runway for, and Ilia just did his part to make the case undeniable. In this clip, we break down how Topuria showed he can deal with bigger, stronger opponents and control the kind of fighters people swore would give him problems. Islam Makhachev, meanwhile, needs a matchup that truly showcases his dominance at the championship level — and the most compelling test for him would be someone like Kamaru Usman if he really wanted to prove he can handle the big, physical welterweights. That’s the stylistic question fans keep circling: can Islam solve someone with Usman’s frame, power, and wrestling pedigree? And when you zoom out, this doesn’t feel like some “changing of the guard” moment. Jack Della Maddalena just had his first title defense — he’s not the old era. Islam isn’t defending a belt; he’s chasing one in a new division. This is a crossroads, not a coronation. If you want to understand how superfights get built, how the UFC positions stars, and why Topuria vs. Makhachev is the collision course everyone’s watching, this is it.

      "description": "Chael Sonnen breaks down the difference between double champ, two-time champ, and the BMF title in the UFC. Using Max Holloway as an example, Chael explains why Max is a two-time champion, not a \"double champ,\" and why the terminology matters for legacy and historical records. He also touches on Islam Makhachev, past UFC eras with Matt Hughes and Tito Ortiz, and why words in MMA are more than just semantics — they define a fighter’s true accomplishments. #MaxHolloway #UFC #ChaelSonnen #DoubleChamp #TwoTimeChamp #BMFTitles #UFCLegacy #IslamMakhachev #UFCTitles #MMABad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Chael Sonnen breaks down the real stakes behind Ian Garry vs Belal Muhammad and exposes why the UFC narrative is focusing ONLY on Ian Garry as a potential title challenger for Islam Makhachev. Chael explains why that storyline ignores Belal’s résumé as a former world champion and why both men should be in equal contention for a title shot. He also dives into Kamaru Usman’s role in all of this — why Usman can’t afford to sit quietly, how Ian Garry will come for his spot through the media, and why this fight affects the entire welterweight landscape. Chael also touches on Islam, the Qatar card, and the politics shaping the division. #IanGarry #BelalMuhammad #KamaruUsman #ChaelSonnen #UFC #UFCRankings #UFCTitleShot #MMA #Makhachev #UFCQatar Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Ricky Simón is the best fighter Chael Sonnen has ever seen in person — explosive, creative, and dangerous in ways most people never truly understand. But today’s story isn’t just about Ricky. It’s about the man who beat him: Vinicius “Lockdog” Oliveira… and why Chael suddenly found himself in a heated back-and-forth with the Brazilian contender. After edging Simón in a decision last year, Lockdog earned Chael’s full respect. Anyone who gets past Ricky is automatically on the radar. But when Lockdog posted two sparring videos showing him dropping training partners — hard — Chael saw something different. These weren’t playful exchanges. These weren’t technical rounds. These were finish-the-guy sequences on teammates who aren’t getting paid to be punching bags. So Chael responded the way Chael does: he told Lockdog he was “being a dick”… and questioned the person filming it. Lockdog didn’t take that well. Instead of sending a tweet, he made a full-on video yelling at Chael, calling him a “jerk” — which, in classic Chael fashion, only made things more confusing (and funnier). In this breakdown, Chael explains why sparring etiquette matters, why Lockdog is too good to be blasting partners, and why posting the footage changes everything. It’s a conversation about respect, professionalism, and what separates gym legends from career tankers.
