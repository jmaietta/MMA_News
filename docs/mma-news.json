      "description": "Everyone knew who number one was going to be. In this episode, Chael Sonnen breaks down why Conor McGregor remains the most compelling figure in MMA heading into 2026 — despite not having fought in years. This isn’t about belts. It’s not about rankings. And it’s not about technique. Chael explains that no matter how good Conor is at a specific skill, there’s always another fighter who can match it. What can’t be matched is the one thing no other fighter has: the mandate of the masses. If Conor wants a fight in February, it happens. If he wants a new weight class in March, it exists. No other fighter — not champions, not contenders — has that kind of pull. From media demand to promotional leverage, Chael lays out why Conor can still command attention from outlets, promoters, and fans in a way no one else can. He also addresses the uncertainty around Conor’s future — boxing, MMA, or retirement — and why the real answer may already be written. Chael reflects on Conor’s withdrawal from the Michael Chandler fight, his relationship with Dana White, and why talk of title fights or matchups with Islam Makhachev may be more fantasy than reality. Love him or hate him, one thing is undeniable: Conor McGregor is still the biggest draw in MMA — and still the number one fighter to watch in 2026.

      "description": "What if there’s no middle ground? In this episode, Chael Sonnen opens his 2026 Fighters to Watch countdown with a hard truth about Justin Gaethje: by this time next year, he’ll either be a world champion — or he’ll be gone. Not fading. Not hanging on. Gone. Chael reflects on the moment every fighter eventually faces — the realization that the sport doesn’t last forever, and that one day it ends whether you’re ready or not. From there, he explains why Gaethje stands apart from so many others at lightweight. This isn’t about money. It isn’t about fame. And it isn’t about not knowing how to leave. Justin Gaethje knows exactly what he wants. With an interim title opportunity at 155 pounds looming, Chael questions the very idea of “interim champions,” calling it a title of grace — and explains why, if Gaethje wins, that belt must become undisputed. If a champion can’t or won’t fight, the belt belongs to the man who will. Chael also breaks down why Gaethje’s mindset matters: when he says “give me a title fight or send me home,” he means it — and he’s willing to step aside cleanly if it doesn’t happen. The looming question: is that enough to beat Paddy Pimblett? That breakdown comes later. For now, this is about stakes, honesty, and a fighter who refuses to linger. Number five on the list: Justin Gaethje. #JustinGaethje #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMA2026 #LightweightDivision #FightAnalysis #FightersToWatchBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Number four on the 2026 “fighters to watch” list isn’t a conventional pick — and that’s exactly why it works. In this episode, Chael Sonnen explains why Jake Paul belongs in the conversation heading into 2026: because every door is open. Boxing is the obvious lane, but Chael argues the bigger story is Jake’s obsession with competition — and the idea that MMA has always been sitting in the background. Chael revisits early footage and rumors that shaped the “Paul brothers can fight” narrative, then zooms out to what actually drives Jake: grit, self-belief, toughness, and the willingness to do the hard work that most people never fully give credit for. This isn’t about a clean jab or perfect fundamentals — it’s about proving he belongs in the arena at all. From the early “celebrity boxing” perception to the moment Jake started chasing legitimacy — rankings, world titles, and the biggest names possible — Chael breaks down how the experiment changed, and why the crowd still refuses to admit what’s right in front of them. And here’s the key: Chael believes everything is still on the table for Jake Paul in 2026… including retirement.

      "description": "Number three on the 2026 fighters-to-watch list is the most complicated name of them all. In this episode, Chael Sonnen explains why Francis Ngannou remains one of the most fascinating figures in combat sports — even though no one, including Francis himself, seems certain about what comes next. Chael pulls back the curtain on what fighters don’t realize until it’s gone: how rare the opportunity to compete truly is. Opponents, promoters, licensing, medicals, venues — everything has to align just to make a fight possible. And once those pieces stop lining up, careers don’t fade… they end. That’s the crossroads Francis now stands at. Chael breaks down the reality of boxing options at this stage of Ngannou’s career, why big-name boxers and promoters may hesitate, and why passing on a massive payday against Jake Paul revealed something important about Francis’ mindset. This isn’t about easy money — it’s about meaning. So where does MMA fit? Chael explores the Professional Fighters League as the most realistic path forward, and dives into potential matchups with Vadim Nemkov or the truly mythical option: Gable Steveson. That leads to the central question of the episode: if you can book any fight, why settle for one that doesn’t matter most? Francis Ngannou still has power. He still has leverage. What remains uncertain is whether the right opportunity — and the right willingness — will present itself in 2026. For that reason alone, Francis Ngannou lands at number three. #FrancisNgannou #ChaelSonnen #MMA #PFL #CombatSports #2026 #FightersToWatchBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Number two on the 2026 fighters-to-watch list isn’t just about winning fights — it’s about ending arguments. In this episode, Chael Sonnen explains why Alex Pereira is one victory away from doing something no fighter has ever done: ending the GOAT conversation entirely. The “greatest of all time” debate has always been about eras, nostalgia, and fan loyalty. It’s not a tournament — it’s a barroom argument. But Chael lays out the case that a heavyweight championship run in 2026 would eliminate the debate altogether. If Pereira becomes heavyweight champion after already holding world titles at middleweight and light heavyweight, the discussion stops. There’s nothing left to argue. Chael revisits a heated ESPN year-in-review debate with Daniel Cormier and Jon Anik, where he argued Pereira should have been Fighter of the Year simply for holding belts in two divisions within a single calendar year. The argument didn’t win then — but history may prove it right. Now the path is clear, but brutal. To reach heavyweight gold, Pereira would likely have to go through Tom Aspinall, Jon Jones, or Ciryl Gane. Every option is dangerous. Every option is possible. What makes this compelling is motivation. Pereira already holds gold. He doesn’t need to do this. But as Chael explains, once a fighter reaches that level, the only thing left is legacy. If Alex Pereira becomes heavyweight champion in 2026 — interim or undisputed — it won’t just be the biggest story of the year. It may be the final word in MMA greatness. That’s why he comes in at number two. #AlexPereira #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMA2026 #GOATDebate #Heavyweight #CombatSportsBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11YAoqVK4HQ",
      "description": "What’s right in MMA isn’t always what’s popular—and nowhere is that more obvious than the heavyweight division. In this clip, Chael Sonnen breaks down why heavyweight is so difficult to predict, promote, and stabilize. From the lack of elite wrestling pedigrees to the absence of clear storytelling, this division doesn’t function like the others—and pretending it does only creates confusion. Chael reacts to conversations around the division involving Jon Jones, Tom Aspinall, and Ciryl Gane, explaining why “big fights” aren’t just opinions—they’re tools. Tools that generate attention, headlines, and engagement… if the story is there. That leads to the biggest question of all: where does Alex Pereira fit into this mess? Does he defend his belt? Does he move up? Does he fight Jon Jones? And if he does—what are they even fighting for? Chael explores interim titles, stripped belts, injured champions, and why Carlos Ulberg may be getting caught in the middle of a situation he didn’t create. The takeaway is simple but uncomfortable: prestige and money aren’t enough. If fans don’t care before the fight, the fight doesn’t matter. This is heavyweight MMA stripped of fantasy booking—what works, what doesn’t, and why the next decision matters more than all the arguments combined.

      "description": "Ian Garry just said the quiet part out loud. Reading his words verbatim, Garry laid out a vision that goes far beyond winning a world title. He claims that when he beats Islam Makhachev, there will be no excuses—and that victory will make him the greatest pound-for-pound fighter in the world. That’s a massive statement. And it raises an even bigger question: How do you become pound-for-pound number one by beating Islam? In this clip, Chael Sonnen breaks down what Garry is really saying, what he might actually be aiming for, and why this isn’t about belts, main events, or even championships. This is about legacy—and about skipping steps that most fighters never even dream of skipping. Chael explores whether Garry is getting ahead of himself, or whether this is the move of a smart storyteller who understands how to place himself in history. From the shadow of Khabib Nurmagomedov to the realities of pound-for-pound rankings, this conversation goes far beyond a single fight. One thing is clear: Ian Garry didn’t say he hopes to be pound-for-pound number one. He said it like a man who believes it’s inevitable. And sometimes, that’s step one.

Cormier GOES IN ON why Jake Paul will once again get knocked out if he chooses to fight Francis, and breaks down the logic behind Ngannou taking that fight this coming year.

      "description": "This wasn’t just the best fight of the year — it was the greatest fight of 2025, and everything surrounding it made it matter more. Chael Sonnen breaks down the fight he ranks number one on his 2025 list: **Diego Lopes vs. Jean Silva. What made this fight unique wasn’t just the action — it was the stakes. Lopes entered the bout coming off a loss, something that almost never leads to a main-event opportunity. Silva, on the other hand, was riding momentum and fresh off dominant performances, making this his biggest spotlight yet. Chael explains the rarely discussed politics of MMA: winners fight winners, losers don’t headline shows — and why this matchup broke that rule. Add in a sold-out crowd, a head-to-head battle with one of the biggest boxing events of the year, and the pressure to deliver, and the consequences couldn’t have been higher. This wasn’t just about winning a fight — it was about relevance, opportunity, and survival. Both men flipped the switch and went forward with bad intentions. It wasn’t pretty, and it wasn’t cautious — it was aggressive, relentless, and decisive. Lopes’ win demanded a reward, and when you understand what he overcame and who he overcame, that reward makes sense. This breakdown explains why this fight stands alone at number one in 2025.

      "description": "This fight wasn’t just emotional — it earned its place as the second-best fight of 2025. Chael Sonnen breaks down the unforgettable showdown between Max Holloway and Dustin Poirier in Lafayette, with the BMF Championship on the line. The stakes couldn’t have been higher — this was Poirier’s final fight, in his home state, with the governor in the front row and the entire arena emotionally invested in the outcome. Chael explains why, despite the circumstances, the judges got it right. Holloway and Poirier once again chose violence over convenience — opting to trade punches in bunches instead of leaning on wrestling, clinch work, or safer paths to victory. It was a technical war fought at full speed, with both men exhausting every option and never slowing down. The breakdown also dives into Max Holloway’s commitment to fighting at 155 pounds, why that mattered in this fight, and how Poirier himself described the difference in Holloway’s power and presence. When sentiment is removed and performance is judged honestly, Chael makes the case clear: this fight belongs at number two on the list of the greatest fights of 2025.

      "description": "Coming in at number three on Chael Sonnen’s Top 5 Fights of 2025 is a fight that wasn’t built on hype, chaos, or a dramatic finish — but on pure skill progression. This co-main event between Valentina Shevchenko and Zhang Weili didn’t make the list because of excitement going in, and it didn’t make the list because of fireworks during the fight. It made the list for one reason only: The Bullet got better. Chael breaks down why Valentina’s ability to out-wrestle Weili repeatedly, in every round, was the real story of the fight. After watching Weili handle elite grapplers like Tatiana Suarez, very few expected Valentina to dominate those same exchanges. But she did — easily, consistently, and without hesitation. That’s what elevates this fight. Valentina was already considered one of the best strikers in MMA history, with past wars against Amanda Nunes cementing her legacy. Seeing her suddenly control fights on the mat wasn’t just impressive — it was a revelation. This breakdown isn’t about who’s next or what comes after. It’s about recognizing greatness when it evolves. That’s why this fight earns the #3 spot of 2025. #ChaelSonnen #TopFights2025 #ValentinaShevchenko #ZhangWeili #MMABreakdown #UFCHistory Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "This wasn’t just a great fight — it was the second-best fight of 2025, and most people watching didn’t realize what they were seeing. Chael Sonnen breaks down the unforgettable war between Jiří Procházka and Khalil Rountree Jr. inside T-Mobile Arena, a fight defined by damage, commitment, and one brutal turning point. For two full rounds, Rountree executed a dangerous and disciplined plan — standing his ground, trading shots, chopping the legs, and pressing for a knockout finish. But fighting Procházka comes with a hidden tax: endurance. Chael explains why committing everything to a finish inside a limited time window can become a liability when the opponent refuses to fall. As Rountree began to fade, Procházka stayed upright — and once that happened, the fight was no longer about who was winning rounds. It became about who could still move. This breakdown explains why this fight ranks second-best of the year, not because of a single moment, but because of the psychology, fatigue, and inevitability that unfolded in real time. If you want to understand how elite fights truly turn, this is one you need to study.

If you want to understand what truly defines a great fight, you have to look beyond finishes and highlights. In this video, Chael Sonnen begins counting down his Top 5 Fights of 2025, starting with the fight that landed at number five — a bout shaped as much by chaos and circumstance as by what happened inside the cage. Before the list begins, Chael also shares why sleep, recovery, and preparation matter at the highest level, and why he trusts Bear Mattress to keep him performing at his best. From wild fight-week conditions to last-minute changes that altered an entire card, this breakdown gives rare insight into what fighters and teams were dealing with behind the scenes. The focus then turns to Umar Nurmagomedov vs. Merab Dvalishvili, a fight that wasn’t supposed to be competitive — until it was. Chael explains how pressure, conditioning, and momentum slowly shifted, why fatigue decided the championship rounds, and how Merab’s ability to have fun under fire signaled the arrival of a new star. This is not just a recap. It’s a lesson in preparation, resilience, and why the best fights are about more than who wins. Watch the full breakdown and stay tuned as Chael counts down the rest of the Top 5. #ChaelSonnen #TopFights2025 #UFCAnalysis #MMABreakdown #BearMattressBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Click here https://bearmattress.com/chael and use CODE: CHAEL to get 40% off your mattress. Valentina Shevchenko has been named Female Fighter of the Year, and for once, Chael Sonnen says it out loud: it feels good to say it. But here’s the issue. Despite her dominance, consistency, and legacy, Valentina Shevchenko continues to be placed in co-main events — a spot Chael believes no longer makes sense for the most accomplished female fighter in MMA history. In this breakdown, Chael explains why greatness in combat sports isn’t judged only by skill, but also by visibility, stakes, and where you’re placed on the card. Drawing on a conversation with Dominick Cruz, Chael lays out an uncomfortable truth: pound-for-pound recognition requires the mandate of the audience, not just technical excellence. Chael breaks down Valentina’s recent run — from her battles with Weili Zhang to the rivalry with Alexa Grasso — and explains why she doesn’t look like an aging champion, but a fighter evolving, adapting, and still climbing the mountain. So why isn’t she headlining? Is it the division? The promotion? Or is it time for Valentina and her team to demand main event status — no more explanations, no more excuses? This is a conversation about legacy, opportunity, and why #FighterOfTheYear should never be hidden in the co-main slot. If you care about #UFC, #WMMA, and what greatness is supposed to look like at the highest level, this one matters.
