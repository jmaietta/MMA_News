      "description": "Ricky Simón is the best fighter Chael Sonnen has ever seen in person — explosive, creative, and dangerous in ways most people never truly understand. But today’s story isn’t just about Ricky. It’s about the man who beat him: Vinicius “Lockdog” Oliveira… and why Chael suddenly found himself in a heated back-and-forth with the Brazilian contender. After edging Simón in a decision last year, Lockdog earned Chael’s full respect. Anyone who gets past Ricky is automatically on the radar. But when Lockdog posted two sparring videos showing him dropping training partners — hard — Chael saw something different. These weren’t playful exchanges. These weren’t technical rounds. These were finish-the-guy sequences on teammates who aren’t getting paid to be punching bags. So Chael responded the way Chael does: he told Lockdog he was “being a dick”… and questioned the person filming it. Lockdog didn’t take that well. Instead of sending a tweet, he made a full-on video yelling at Chael, calling him a “jerk” — which, in classic Chael fashion, only made things more confusing (and funnier). In this breakdown, Chael explains why sparring etiquette matters, why Lockdog is too good to be blasting partners, and why posting the footage changes everything. It’s a conversation about respect, professionalism, and what separates gym legends from career tankers.

      "title": "Did Hooker Deserve That Headbutt?",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BDsAoLqXIY",
      "description": "Things got heated at the Dan Hooker vs. Arman Tsarukyan face-off — but the headlines aren’t telling the full story. Before you decide who’s to blame, let’s walk through exactly what happened and why this moment is more complicated than people want to admit. In today’s breakdown, Chael Sonnen digs into the now-viral clip labeled as “Tsarukyan loses his cool and headbutts Hooker.” But is that what actually happened? Hooker gave the first provocation — a hard flinch — and in the world of two certified tough guys, that’s not nothing. Tsarukyan has a reputation as a dangerous man who has literally fought two people in one night on his walk to the cage. Hooker is a respected veteran who doesn’t back up from anybody. When two “bad guys” collide, there’s usually honor among thieves. Rarely does one try to out-bad-guy the other. So did Tsarukyan cross a line? Did Hooker start the whole thing? And how does a simple flinch turn into a headbutt that shifts public sympathy overnight? This is wrestling psychology 101 — a full heel-turn dynamic straight out of Vince McMahon’s playbook. In this video, Chael breaks down the moment frame-by-frame, explains why public perception flipped so quickly, and asks you to serve as the jury on who really caused this melee.

      "description": "Dana White tells a story here that flips the entire Francis Ngannou narrative on its head. If you think you know why the heavyweight champion walked away from the UFC, this breakdown hits you with a much different picture. In this clip, we revisit the moment Ngannou was earning roughly $600,000 per fight while asking for a raise — even though, as Dana explains, his contract already included the path to much bigger money through pay-per-view points. That structure exists so champions show up, do media, and push their own event. But when Ngannou fought Ciryl Gane in what was supposed to be a massive heavyweight pay-per-view, the numbers didn’t deliver. And from the UFC’s perspective, the champion left millions on the table that most athletes in his position would’ve earned automatically. This segment lays out the tension perfectly: the UFC attempted to keep Ngannou, but the incentives, expectations, and reality of the PPV market didn’t line up with what he believed he deserved. It’s a rare look into fighter economics, star power, and the business decisions that shape MMA careers. If you’re into the behind-the-scenes truth of UFC contracts, heavyweight politics, and the real money conversations nobody wants to say out loud, this is must-watch material.

      "description": "Chael Sonnen is out in California shooting a Black Rifle Coffee commercial alongside Dustin Poirier, Miesha Tate, and Cory Sandhagen — and it leads to a conversation he didn’t expect. It’s the first time Chael has seen Dustin face-to-face since his retirement after the BMF title fight against Max Holloway… and one thing becomes clear fast: Dustin Poirier still looks like a top-five lightweight. Chael breaks down why Poirier’s retirement is so rare, why almost no elite fighters walk away while still at the top (besides GSP, Khabib, and Mayweather), and the psychology of an athlete who still has “juice left” even after choosing to step away. Chael also shares his past experiences with Michael Bisping, the signs that show a fighter isn’t mentally done, and why Poirier’s interest in boxing, grappling, or a Nate Diaz matchup adds a new wrinkle to the conversation. If you love deep MMA psychology, fighter legacy breakdowns, or inside stories from Chael’s world, this is a must-watch. #chaelsonnen #dustinpoirier #ufc #mma #bmf #ufcnews #ufcfighter #blackriflecoffeeBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

From a phone call with Johnny Hendricks before Mike Pierce to years of being unintentionally critical of Cory Sandhagen, Chael explains how commentary, criticism, and coincidence collide in MMA. In this episode, Chael tells the full story behind the now-famous Cory Sandhagen t-shirt, what really happened when he finally met Cory for the first time, and why fighters should never take critiques personally.

      "description": "This might be the bluntest breakdown you’ll hear — because that fight wasn’t just slow, it was one of the most uneventful UFC championship performances in years. A single, basic double-leg takedown — the very first technique you learn on day one of wrestling practice — took down a world champion. And the shocking part? He never got back to his feet. Not once. In this clip, I break down why the entire fight fell flat, why Islam Makhachev controlled so easily, and why neither the champion nor the challenger showed the urgency fans expect at the elite level. We’re talking fundamentals, scrambling, defensive responsibility, and the criteria that judges actually require: advancing position and damaging your opponent. None of that showed up here. If you want to understand what went wrong — technically, strategically, and mentally — this is the analysis you need. This isn’t about criticizing fighters; it’s about setting the record straight on what championship-level MMA is supposed to look like. Stick around, because the takeaway here is simple: dominance means nothing if the fight itself has no fire. 👉 Watch more breakdowns, analysis, and real talk straight from the world of MMA.",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9h1WJAHS-Y",
      "description": "Logan Paul claims he once tried to go over Dana White’s head and book a boxing match with Conor McGregor — a fight he says would have paid each man $250 million. A half-billion dollar purse for one crossover fight. And today, Chael Sonnen is here to break down why that number has never made sense, doesn’t make sense now, and will never make sense in the real world of combat sports. Chael explains why these massive fantasy numbers always seem to come from boxing, why fighters keep repeating them as if they’re gospel, and why fans still buy into the idea that someone is writing quarter-billion-dollar checks. He digs into the long history of “biggest payday ever” claims, from Tyson to Mayweather, and why the math behind these fairy tales never adds up. More importantly, Chael breaks down the piece everyone conveniently forgets: If someone is paying $250 million… who’s writing the check? Where’s the promoter? Where’s the billionaire in the front row? Where’s the guy whose ego would demand all the camera time in the world? According to Chael, that character never appears because the story isn’t nonfiction — it’s entertainment, it’s mythology, and it’s the same recycled boxing lie that’s been floating around for decades. If you enjoy Chael dissecting the fight world’s tall tales, this is classic Uncle Chael at his best. #chaelsonnen #loganpaul #conormcgregor #boxing #ufc #mma #danawhite #fighttalk #combat sports Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

While filming a commercial with Dustin Poirier, Cory Sandhagen, and Miesha Tate, the fighters start talking about Dana White’s claim that Francis Ngannou once got physical during negotiations. That sparks Chael’s memory of his own “incident” with Francis in a parking garage after Nate Diaz vs. Jake Paul. Chael remembers the moment vividly: Francis at a “10 out of 10” on the anger scale, squaring up, and security yelling. But when Chael brings in his ONE eyewitness — his son — the entire story unravels. Did Francis ever square up? Did he ever yell? Did anything even happen… at all? According to Chael’s son: Nope. None of it. This turns into one of the funniest, most self-aware breakdowns Chael has done in years, as he tries to figure out whether he survived a confrontation with “The Predator”… or whether he just manufactured a great story in his own head.

But just because it’s happening doesn’t mean it’s a smart idea. When Dana White said, “Be careful what you ask for,” this is exactly the kind of matchup he was talking about. Jake finally gets what so many critics demanded: a seasoned, in-his-prime, legitimate heavyweight boxer. And not just any heavyweight — Anthony Joshua, a former unified world champion with knockout power and elite experience. In this video, I break down why Jake Paul deserves credit for the sheer courage it takes to sign this fight, and why moral victories might be the realistic goal here. Surviving the first round, surviving the second, avoiding early knockdowns — those would be major wins against a man of Joshua’s caliber. But when we’re talking skill-for-skill, size-for-size, and experience-for-experience, this has all the signs of a one-sided matchup. If you want the honest truth about what Jake is stepping into, what Joshua brings to the table, and where the real dangers lie, this clip lays it all out without sugarcoating a single detail. 👉 Subscribe for more real fight breakdowns, predictions, and no-nonsense analysis.",

Those aren’t small accusations, especially when you’re talking about one of the most dominant champions in modern UFC history. But here’s where things get interesting: we still haven’t seen much of Ilia’s takedown defense tested at the elite level. And part of that is because most guys don’t even try to take him down. In this video, I dive into whether Ilia is talking about freestyle wrestling, Greco-Roman, straight grappling, or cage wrestling — because all of those are very different conversations. And if you’re going after a pound-for-pound number one, you better be specific, and you better be sharp. Ilia calling his shots, barking at Islam to speed things up, trying to dictate the terms — it’s entertaining, it’s fiery, and it’s exactly the kind of energy fans love. But does that mean he runs the division? No. Does that mean he runs the sport? Absolutely not. This clip breaks down the claims, the techniques, and the reality behind whether Ilia can back up the talk when the cage door closes. 👉 Stick around for more real MMA analysis and no-nonsense breakdowns.",

In this clip, I break down why Jack’s punches looked non-existent, why none of his shots carried intimidation or damage, and why the entire fight became a rinse-and-repeat cycle of staying on the ground and doing absolutely nothing. Ten straight rounds of the same positions, the same stalls, and no urgency from either fighter — all while the crowd booed and the referee refused to intervene.

      "description": "\"Overreaction Time\" (Tuesdays, noon ET) is a weekly podcast hosted by MMA Junkie managing editor Simon Samano where he shares his \"overreactions\" with an MMA Junkie staff member, and the debate begins! On this edition, he and MMA Junkie reporter Farah Hannoun discuss the following: (00:00) - Intro (01:10) - Islam Makhachev’s welterweight title win puts him ahead of Khabib as an all-time UFC great. (06:21) - Islam Makhachev vs. Ilia Topuria makes sense only as a lightweight fight. (11:45) - Valentina Shevchenko sure looked like the greatest female fighter of all time at UFC 322 — and she just might be! (18:37) - Sorry, Kamaru Usman, but you can forget about that next title shot you wanted. (26:03) - Bo Nickal might’ve saved his title aspirations at UFC 322. (31:16) - Arman Tsarukyan and Ian Machado Garry winning is the best outcome for the UFC this weekend. (37:54) - Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua is good for the fighters, bad for boxing.

      "description": "Jake Paul haters have finally gotten what they wanted — a fight against a real, seasoned boxer in his prime: Anthony Joshua! Chael Sonnen breaks down exactly what this matchup means, why it’s a massive step up for Paul, and why this fight could get one-sided fast. Unlike his previous matches, Joshua isn’t an exhibition opponent. He’s a true world-class fighter with power, size, and boxing experience. Chael explains how Paul will need courage, strategy, and every ounce of skill to survive the rounds. He also highlights the “moral victories” — lasting through the early rounds, staying on his feet, and facing the kind of danger he hasn’t encountered before. Dana White warned the audience: you wanted a real fight, and that’s exactly what you’re getting. This clip dives deep into the stakes for both fighters, the business side of the matchup, and why this fight matters beyond social media hype. Sonnen provides insight into the preparation, strategy, and drama behind one of boxing’s most talked-about events. Watch now for a detailed breakdown of Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua, one of the most anticipated fights of the year. Chael Sonnen’s analysis will give you a full picture of the risks, rewards, and brutal realities ahead. #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #Boxing #ChaelSonnen #FightAnalysis #PaulVsJoshua Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
