Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Waldo Cortes-Acosta floated an idea that stopped me in my tracks: it might be time for an interim heavyweight title. And the more you look at the current landscape, the harder it is to dismiss. The UFC has no clear parameters for when a champion must defend. Boxing does. Pro wrestling used to. Even other sports have timelines. But at heavyweight, we’re operating without a clock. Tom Aspinall is the undisputed champion, injured in the Octagon, and that matters. If anyone deserves patience, it’s him. This isn’t about stripping Tom. It’s about keeping the division moving while he heals. The problem is clarity. We don’t know how long Aspinall will be out, and we don’t know what the plan is. Holding everything for a Ciryl Gane rematch might sound logical, but timing matters. That first fight was the lowest-performing pay-per-view of the year, and momentum fades fast. Waiting another four or five months doesn’t help anyone—especially the rest of the division. Here’s the bigger issue: who exactly would even fight for an interim belt? Interim titles usually exist to justify massive, unavoidable fights. At heavyweight, that fight doesn’t obviously exist. Outside of a handful of names—and one undefeated wrestler, Josh Hockett—the division is thin. Wrestling, the most dominant skill set in MMA history, is nearly absent at heavyweight right now. Waldo’s idea isn’t wrong. It’s just incomplete. An interim belt only works if there’s a fight worthy of it. And that’s the question nobody’s answering. Watch the full breakdown and decide whether heavyweight needs an interim champion—or a complete reset. #UFC #Heavyweight #TomAspinall #InterimTitle #MMA #FightBusiness #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Jorge Masvidal doesn’t hand out compliments. That’s why this one matters. Masvidal recently said Ilia Topuria is the Michael Jordan of MMA—and then doubled down. He explained that if Topuria were to move up, beat Islam Makhachev, and hold championships at multiple weights, there would be no debate left. No Jon Jones. No Georges St-Pierre. No Khabib Nurmagomedov. Everyone else moves back. That’s a massive statement, and it deserves to be examined carefully. In this breakdown, I explain why Masvidal’s comparison isn’t just hype. Competition-wise, Ilia Topuria is already doing things we’ve almost never seen. He’s beaten Alexander Volkanovski. He’s finished Charles Oliveira. And while paperwork and timing matter in this sport, they don’t erase what’s happening inside the cage. I also explore the counter-argument. Do we really know enough yet? Beating Islam Makhachev isn’t like beating anyone else. The wrestling pressure, conditioning, and composure at 155 are different. And the lightweight title picture is complicated, with Arman Tsarukyan still looming and recent championship changes raising fair questions. To settle it, I asked fighters behind the scenes—former champions, contenders, peers. The answer was unanimous. Yes, Ilia Topuria is that good. Yes, we’ve seen enough. And no, there isn’t some hidden boogeyman waiting to expose him. The way you’re talked about behind your back matters. And right now, Ilia Topuria’s peers are saying something rare.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Conor McGregor has made something clear: before he returns to the UFC, he wants a direct conversation with Ari Emanuel—and he’s done talking through Dana White. That may sound dramatic, but when you dig into it, it’s not unreasonable at all. The UFC McGregor left years ago is not the UFC that exists today. The business model has changed. Pay-per-view points are no longer what they used to be, main events are no longer automatic, and even Conor’s contract structure was built around one assumption—that he headlines. Every time. So before committing to another massive event, McGregor wants clarity. Not hype. Not promises. Numbers. This breakdown explores what that call would actually be about: money, placement, guarantees, and whether Conor McGregor would ever accept a non–main event role. Because once you give up that top spot, you don’t get it back. Ever. Especially if you’re not holding a belt. We also look at how rare pay-per-view exceptions are, why fighters are sometimes paid to not fight elsewhere, and how Conor’s past leverage tactics compare to today’s landscape. This isn’t about ego—it’s about leverage in a business that’s changed underneath him. If Conor fights again, this call happens first. And what’s said on that call will tell us everything about where he really stands. Watch the full breakdown and decide what you think that conversation sounds like. #UFC #ConorMcGregor #AriEmanuel #DanaWhite #MMA #FightBusiness #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnenchBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Brown came out and said he wouldn’t pick Paddy Pimblett against anyone in the top 10—and maybe not even 11 or 12. That’s a strong statement, and it deserves a closer look. Yes, Paddy didn’t look great in that fight. Nobody’s arguing that. But judging a fighter’s entire ceiling off one performance—especially their first five-round, title-level main event—is dangerous. MMA changes when you change the rules. A five-round fight isn’t the same sport as a three-round fight, and history proves that over and over again. We’ve seen elite fighters look flat under the lights before. We saw it with Max Holloway against Alexander Volkanovski. We’ve seen wars like Dan Henderson vs Shogun Rua that weren’t technical masterpieces—but winning mattered more than polish. Skill doesn’t always look pretty, and sometimes survival is the skill. Paddy has positions where he’s dangerous. If he gets on top, he can change a fight. Does that specific performance beat the top 10? Maybe not. But judging the full body of work tells a different story. Fighters usually look better the second time they carry that kind of weight. Criticize the night if you want—but don’t close the book on the career.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Kamaru Usman has a theory—and the more you think about it, the more it explains everything happening around Khamzat Chimaev. Chimaev keeps calling out Alex Pereira, and from a pure fight perspective, it’s fascinating. Pereira is respected, intimidating, and universally liked inside the UFC. That matters. It’s also why this callout hasn’t gotten the push fans expect. But Usman suggests this isn’t about champion-hunting or hype at all. It’s about size. According to Usman, Chimaev may have outgrown the middleweight division entirely. There are rumors—just rumors—that Khamzat walks around extremely heavy, and if that’s true, it explains a lot. It explains why Chimaev vs Dricus du Plessis hasn’t been booked. It explains the delay. And it explains why the Pereira talk won’t go away. The UFC doesn’t like fighters bouncing between divisions. Exceptions are rare. Ilia Topuria and Islam Makhachev earned theirs for very specific reasons. For Chimaev to move to 205, he’d likely have to vacate his place at 185 entirely—and that changes the entire conversation. If Usman is right, this isn’t a stalled division or bad timing. It’s a fighter facing a hard reality and a difficult phone call. And if that call happens, everything about Khamzat Chimaev’s future changes overnight. Watch the full breakdown and decide if this theory finally makes it all make sense. #UFC #KhamzatChimaev #AlexPereira #KamaruUsman #MMA #FightBusiness #UFCRankings #ChaelSonnenBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Shavkat Rakhmonov didn’t lose. He didn’t retire. He didn’t fall down the rankings. He disappeared. And that raises a question the UFC has never answered clearly: how do the rankings actually work? Rakhmonov was undefeated, dominant, and consistently ranked near the top. Then suddenly—he’s gone. The explanation floating around is injury, with his manager Danny Rubenstein confirming knee surgery that could keep him out for most of the year. But that alone doesn’t explain removal. Champions like Ilia Topuria remain ranked while inactive, and Jon Jones has been removed despite actively pursuing a fight. So what’s the real rule? In this breakdown, I question whether the rankings are truly voted on the way fans believe. Is this really an independent panel reaching the same conclusion? Or are fighters quietly removed before ballots are ever submitted? Because it’s hard to believe that enough voters independently decided an undefeated fighter—who’s beaten multiple ranked opponents—suddenly doesn’t belong anywhere. This isn’t about conspiracies. It’s about transparency. If a fighter doesn’t move down, but instead vanishes entirely, someone made that call. And the real mystery isn’t why Shavkat Rakhmonov is gone—it’s who had the authority to take his name off the list. Watch the full breakdown and decide for yourself.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Everyone keeps asking what makes sense for Paddy Pimblett next. That’s the wrong question. In the fight business, only one thing matters—and that’s winning. Sean O’Malley recently said the UFC has to make Paddy Pimblett vs Dan Hooker, and he’s right. This matchup isn’t about rankings or spreadsheets. It’s about timing, availability, and heat. Paddy is coming off a loss. Dan Hooker is coming off a loss. That doesn’t close the door—it opens it. That’s how real matchmaking works. In this breakdown, I explain why the Hooker fight is not only possible, but obvious. We look at why talk of Arman Tsarukyan, Benoît Saint Denis, and other options sounds good on paper but falls apart in practice. Promoters don’t start at ground zero when a storyline already exists—and Paddy vs Hooker already has history, tension, and audience interest. I also explain why the word “sense” gets fighters and managers into trouble, and how winning the right fight matters more than fighting the “right” guy. If you understand how contenders actually get rebuilt and pushed, this clip tells you everything you need to know. Watch the full breakdown and decide for yourself—because in the end, this one isn’t complicated.

      "description": "Alexander Volkanovski doesn’t just fight — he outworks you, outlasts you, and somehow finds a way. Every single time. Chael Sonnen breaks down what makes Volk different. Winning one gritty fight takes heart. Doing it over and over for years? That takes a lifetime of work. And now, Volkanovski is tying José Aldo’s legendary featherweight record, putting himself in rare air among the greatest 145-pounders ever. For a moment, it felt like this might be the end. His tone was calm. Almost reflective. Like a guy who might be ready to hang them up. And honestly, if Volk had retired, nobody would’ve questioned it. He’s earned that right. But then he did the opposite. Instead of walking away, Volkanovski called out Movsar Evloev and Lerone Murphy — two of the toughest, hungriest contenders in the division. No easy fights. No victory laps. Just straight back into the fire. That tells you everything. Chael explains why that mentality separates champions from legends. Some guys protect their legacy. Volk keeps testing it. He’s not chasing comfort — he’s chasing competition. Retirement doesn’t sound like a man calling out killers. This isn’t the end. It might be another run. #AlexanderVolkanovski #UFC #MMA #JoseAldo #MovsarEvloev #LeroneMurphy #Featherweight #ChaelSonnen",

      "description": "Alexander Volkanovski was closer to becoming a double champion than people remember — and Chael Sonnen thinks he might have actually beaten Islam Makhachev that first night. Not “competitive.” Not “moral victory.” Chael means flat-out won. In this breakdown, Chael revisits their first lightweight title fight and explains why Volk’s performance ages better every single time we watch Islam dominate the division. Makhachev is breaking records, running through contenders, even flirting with welterweight — and we’re supposed to forget that Volkanovski pushed him to the absolute limit? Volk clearly won two rounds. Some argue three. And when the decision came in, nobody felt certain. That’s how close it was. But here’s Chael’s key point: commitment. If Volkanovski had fully relinquished the 145-pound belt and truly moved up to 155 — bigger camp, bigger body, fully adjusted — maybe that tiny gap disappears. Maybe that razor-close fight flips. Maybe we’re talking about “champ-champ” Volk right now. Instead, he tried to do both. And at the highest level, half-measures cost you inches — and inches cost you titles. Looking back, it might be one of the biggest “what ifs” in UFC history. #AlexanderVolkanovski #IslamMakhachev #UFC #MMA #DoubleChamp #Lightweight #Featherweight #chaelsonnen",

This wasn’t trash talk or bravado — it was hard to watch, and it raised real questions about what’s been happening behind the scenes. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains the quiet timeline of Rakhmonov’s injuries, including what now appears to be a second knee surgery and why that matters. After his fight with Stephen Thompson, the story was unclear. Achilles? Foot? Ankle? Then after going the distance for the first time against Ian Garry, the narrative shifted to a compromised knee — but nothing was ever confirmed publicly. Now, with Rakhmonov potentially sidelined another 9–10 months, the entire welterweight division is forced to move forward without its clear number one contender. That raises major questions about what comes next for Islam Makhachev, Kamaru Usman, Michael Morales, and how Ian Garry fits into the picture. This isn’t speculation for clicks — it’s about understanding the reality of injuries, timelines, and opportunity in the UFC. Most importantly, it’s about recognizing what Rakhmonov has dealt with quietly and why the division looks completely different right now.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VOMWKoXBDI",
      "description": "The retirement talk around Alexander Volkanovski doesn’t match reality — and his coach just made that clear. After the fight, Volkanovski’s coach spoke openly about camp, injuries, and the future, including a shoulder issue serious enough that they considered pulling out of the fight. This wasn’t adrenaline or hype. It was an honest assessment, and it came with a surprising statement: they believe Volkanovski still has four more fights in him. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains why the idea of Volkanovski retiring now doesn’t add up. Yes, he’s fought at home. Yes, he’s broken records. Yes, he’s cemented his legacy. But Volkanovski has also been transparent about something else — free time is not good for him. He needs structure, goals, and competition. Walking away doesn’t solve that. Great champions face this moment differently. Some leave on top, like Khabib Nurmagomedov. Others keep competing because that’s who they are. Volkanovski fits the second category. The most important part? The gap. One judge scored the fight five rounds to none. Volkanovski could fight worse than he did Saturday and still be better than the rest of the division. That level of separation is rare — and it means retirement isn’t imminent. Four fights doesn’t sound crazy. It sounds realistic.

In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen walks through the logic behind Alexander Volkanovski vs Diego Lopes and why the rematch raises more questions than answers. Especially now that Ilia Topuria vs Lerone Murphy has been announced as the next main event. Traditionally, title contenders don’t fight each other — one of them beats the former number-one contender to earn the shot. That’s not what happened here. Lopes received a title opportunity, lost every round on at least one scorecard, and now the division is left trying to figure out what that performance actually means. If Lopes truly earned the title shot, the rankings should reflect it. If he didn’t, then why did the UFC make the fight in the first place? That’s not criticism — it’s curiosity. Rankings are supposed to tell us who can beat the field and who can challenge the champion. Right now, the featherweight picture feels blurry. And I’m genuinely trying to figure out what I missed.

Benoît Saint Denis called for a BMF title shot — and while there’s no questioning how tough he is, that doesn’t automatically make him eligible. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains why Benoît Saint Denis does not qualify for a BMF title fight right now, even though he is undeniably one of the most dangerous fighters in the sport. This isn’t about skill, toughness, or courage — Saint Denis has all of that. The issue is what the BMF title has always represented. Chael revisits the origins of the BMF belt, starting with Jorge Masvidal vs Nate Diaz, and Dana White’s explanation that “you’ll know it when you see it.” The BMF isn’t a rankings-based award. It’s built on longevity, reputation, willingness, short-notice fights, and earning respect over time from the MMA community. That’s why fighters like Max Holloway belong in that conversation — and why Saint Denis, despite being a legitimate bad dude, simply hasn’t been around long enough yet. This isn’t an insult. It’s the opposite. Saint Denis is on the path — just not at the destination. And if the BMF title starts ignoring its own standards, it loses what makes it special.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Paddy Pimblett took a shot at Dan Hooker, then casually floated Benoît Saint Denis as his next matchup — and that’s where things stopped making sense. In this clip, Chael Sonnen breaks down Paddy Pimblett’s recent comments, including why dismissing Dan Hooker after a loss may actually work against him in the UFC’s matchmaking system. Paddy suggested Hooker is no longer relevant because he lost — but Paddy himself is coming off a loss, which complicates the logic. If anything, that result may make the Hooker fight more likely, not less. Chael also dives into the Benoît Saint Denis situation and explains why that matchup doesn’t clearly benefit Paddy at this stage. Saint Denis has been calling out nearly everyone in the top five, including Charles Oliveira, Max Holloway, Ilia Topuria, Justin Gaethje, and Arman Tsarukyan — a strategy that creates confusion rather than momentum. The real takeaway? Callouts matter, but clarity matters more. Fighters need their fans and momentum moving in one direction, and right now neither Paddy Pimblett nor Benoît Saint Denis has made it clear what fight actually advances them. Watch the full breakdown and decide for yourself which fight makes the most sense next.

At heavyweight, Chael argues, there’s a point where skill acquisition hits a ceiling and fighters must operate within the limits of their bodies. Tai lives in that reality — and embraces it. Chael compares Tuivasa to fighters like Derrick Lewis and even a modern-day Tank Abbott, emphasizing that Tai isn’t a technician off his back or a jiu-jitsu specialist. He’s a cage fighter. A street fighter. And that’s not a flaw — it’s his identity. Despite questioning himself early in the fight and finding himself in bad positions, Tuivasa never chose the easy way out. Chael breaks down how many fighters quietly quit through positional surrender — and why Tai simply doesn’t know how to do that. Instead, he fought through exhaustion, adversity, and doubt, finding his way back to his feet and back into the fight. Even in defeat, Chael believes Tuivasa discovered something important: he’s tougher, more competitive, and more capable than he realized. And in heavyweight MMA, that may be the rarest commodity of all.
