Or will another name be making headlines when it‚Äôs all said and done? You do not want to miss what the guys think Monday‚Äôs headline will be. Then, the women‚Äôs strawweight belt is up for grabs in the co-main event. And it‚Äôs a rematch five years in the making when Virna Jandiroba takes on Mackenzie Dern. But does their first fight even matter once that Octagon door closes? Plus, to throw in the towel or not throw in the towel? That is the question when it comes to Reiner de Ridder and the decision to save him from being mauled by Brendan Allen in the fifth round last week in Vancouver.
