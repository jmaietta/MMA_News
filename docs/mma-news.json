      "title": "The “Bad Guy Inc” Story That Says Everything",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n93Ww--35bU",
      "description": "Follow Misha on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/mishaparsons Chael Sonnen shares a Bad Guy Inc. story from fight week that has nothing to do with punches — and everything to do with character. With Oban Elliott in Australia preparing to compete after a year of cancelled fights and disrupted camps, Sonnen explains why Elliott has always been built for chaos. A former railroad worker who trained after exhausting shifts just to chase the UFC dream, Elliott isn’t the type that folds when plans change — he adjusts and keeps moving. Sonnen then tells what happened when Misha Parsons, Bad Guy Inc.’s 18-year-old photographer traveling solo with her camera, tried to get access for photos. She was turned away at first — and later approached Alexander Volkanovski directly with the same request. Even with credentials in hand, she was told no. Sonnen is careful not to accuse Volkanovski of anything, acknowledging the stress and nonstop demands that come with fight week. But he admits it felt personal, because Chael’s name was part of the ask. Then comes the contrast. Sonnen reaches out to Oban Elliott — expecting delays, managers, logistics. Instead, Elliott responds immediately, tells her directly: “You are part of the team,” gets her a wristband, and gives full access — even to moments fighters usually protect, like the weight cut. Sonnen’s takeaway is simple: MMA doesn’t just build character — sometimes it reveals it. And Oban Elliott revealed his. #UFC #ObanElliott #AlexanderVolkanovski #MMA #ChaelSonnen #FightWeek #BadGuyInc Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Chael Sonnen breaks down the fallout from Justin Gaethje vs Paddy Pimblett and why one win may have quietly scrambled multiple UFC plans at lightweight. In this video, Sonnen reacts to the backlash around the fight’s “sloppy” label, including comments from Arman Tsarukyan, then pivots to the real question: what do you do with Gaethje and Pimblett now? Sonnen also tackles the ongoing confusion around what an interim title actually means in today’s UFC landscape, using the recent Tom Aspinall / Jon Jones situation as the example that changed how fans view the belt. Sonnen then shares his perspective on the matchmaking ripple effects involving Conor McGregor, including why weight (155 vs a higher number) matters more than fans want to admit, and how a belt complicates everything. He explains why Ilia Topuria may be the happiest person in the division right now, how Tsarukyan’s position gets affected, and why Pimblett remains a massive star even coming off a loss. Finally, Sonnen floats a practical next step that keeps the division moving: Paddy Pimblett vs the winner of Benoît Saint Denis vs Dan Hooker—and asks the audience if it passes the smell test. This video includes a paid partner segment with Kalshi, a legal U.S. prediction market. #UFC #JustinGaethje #PaddyPimblett #ConorMcGregor #IliaTopuria #ArmanTsarukyan #MMA #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "You can go to my partner https://kalshi.com/chael and get $10 when you trade $100. Chael Sonnen examines whether Arman Tsarukyan has become the hottest fighter in the UFC — not just inside the Octagon, but in the media, headlines, and online conversation. In this breakdown, Chael explains how Tsarukyan has quietly taken control of the narrative at lightweight, generating more attention and discussion than nearly anyone else in the division. From viral moments to unexpected food-related clips, Tsarukyan has found a way to stay relevant while the title picture at 155 pounds remains jammed. The discussion centers on Tsarukyan’s recent statement that he is the clear number one contender — and that if the lightweight division is stalled, he is willing to drop to 145 pounds to fight for a championship. Sonnen explains why statements like this matter once they’re said publicly, how they force responses from champions and contenders, and why Tsarukyan may be more serious than fans initially believe. Sonnen also questions whether moving to featherweight actually solves a problem or simply shifts the logjam to another division already crowded with deserving contenders. He compares the situation to past debates about champions moving weight classes and whether bigger fighters should be allowed to skip the line. While Sonnen ultimately believes Tsarukyan will be fine staying at lightweight, he praises the strategy for what it is: smart pressure, smart media control, and a way to make it clear that Tsarukyan refuses to wait quietly. The question now is simple — do fans still love the idea after thinking about it for a day? #UFC #ArmanTsarukyan #MMA #UFCLightweight #UFCFeatherweight #ChaelSonnen #FightBusiness Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwZw4kSldk",
      "description": "Chael Sonnen reflects on one of the most difficult and confusing moments in the career of Rose Namajunas, a multi-time UFC champion and future Hall of Famer who has repeatedly found herself in situations few champions ever face. In this video, Sonnen explains why Rose’s career defies logic on paper. Despite dominant wins, clean knockouts, and clear title defenses, she has repeatedly been forced into immediate rematches after victories that were neither controversial nor competitive. Sonnen compares her career path to riddles seen on the men’s side of the sport, where outcomes and opportunities often fail to align. Sonnen breaks down Rose’s most recent fight, a competitive bout that he personally believed she won, only to see the judges’ decision — and the reaction of a 17,000-person live audience — tell a different story. While Sonnen is careful not to diminish her opponent’s achievement, he raises an unavoidable question: when the judges and the crowd disagree, and a former champion loses a third title-eliminator opportunity, what comes next? The discussion also touches on Rose’s decision to move weight classes, the physical toll of the fight — including a torn thumb — and the emotional weight of competing on a massive stage where millions are watching. This isn’t a debate about judging. It’s a deeper look at fairness, timing, and how unforgiving MMA can be — even to its greatest champions. #UFC #RoseNamajunas #MMA #FightAnalysis #ChaelSonnen #WomensMMABad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "After UFC 324, the big question is simple: what does Paddy Pimblett do next? After a brutal five-round loss to Justin Gaethje, Paddy proved what many doubters questioned — his toughness, heart, and refusal to quit at the elite level. But if the goal is still to become UFC champion, changes are needed. From tightening up his striking defense and boxing fundamentals to making a serious investment in wrestling, this breakdown looks at what Paddy did right, what went wrong, and how he evolves from here. With the lightweight rankings taking shape, one matchup stands out above the rest — Paddy Pimblett vs Dan Hooker. Ranked back-to-back, real heat, real stakes, and a guaranteed war. Is this the perfect next fight, or am I out of my mind?

This move could completely reshape: • Fighter incentives • Fight strategies • Risk-taking in the cage • Pay structure across the card 💬 Is this better for fighters — or worse?

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO4SHHbdcKw",
      "description": "Chael Sonnen breaks down why he initially believed Paddy Pimblett would defeat Justin Gaethje, and how fight week completely changed the narrative once the cage door closed. Sonnen explains how Gaethje’s unusual demeanor throughout fight week—angrier, more confrontational, and visibly irritated—signaled that something different was coming. While Sonnen originally leaned toward Pimblett based on youth, momentum, and grappling upside, Gaethje’s pressure, conditioning, and control quickly dismantled that expectation. The analysis focuses on Gaethje’s ability to dictate where fights take place. Using elite anti-wrestling, forward pressure, and relentless pace, Gaethje kept the fight exactly where he wanted it—on the feet, moving forward, and backing Pimblett up. Sonnen explains why backing up is one of the hardest things for a wrestler to overcome, and how Gaethje’s pressure neutralized Pimblett’s offense round after round. Sonnen also addresses the narrative of “old” or “vintage” Gaethje, explaining why this wasn’t a resurgence at all—but simply the same fighter fans have always seen. Gaethje walks opponents down, breaks them over time, and refuses to give ground. Finally, Sonnen looks ahead at what this result means for the lightweight division, including potential future opponents and why the loser of this fight may have ended up in a better position than the winner.

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL ! #bruntpochael Chael Sonnen breaks down why the outcome of Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett was far more predictable than it appeared heading into fight night. In this analysis, Sonnen explains how press conferences and fight-week behavior are often misunderstood. While most fans watch for entertainment, experienced analysts look for tells—subtle indicators of confidence, clarity, and realistic paths to victory. According to Sonnen, both fighters already knew who the better athlete was. The real question was never who would win, but how. Sonnen walks through Pimblett’s only viable strategy: submission. He then methodically explains why that path required a series of unlikely events—multiple takedowns, sustained control, positional advancement, and a finish against one of the best anti-wrestlers in the sport. By contrast, Gaethje’s path to victory was simple and immediate. The fight begins on the feet, and Gaethje thrives there. The breakdown also explores why submissions at the elite level are often the result of fatigue rather than dominance, and why expecting Gaethje to quit under pressure was unrealistic. Sonnen compares Pimblett’s challenge to the difficulty elite fighters like Khabib Nurmagomedov and Michael Chandler had keeping Gaethje down. Finally, Sonnen explains why outside influence—conversations with respected fighters and coaches—temporarily shifted his prediction, and how fight week ultimately revealed the truth. This is a masterclass in reading fights before they happen. #UFC #JustinGaethje #PaddyPimblett #MMA #FightAnalysis #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

In this breakdown, Sonnen explains why the matchup never fully made sense going in. There was no personal rivalry, no promotional tension, and very little upside for O’Malley despite the risk. The crowd reaction, the momentum shifts during the fight, and the uncertainty afterward all reinforced how razor-thin the margin was. Sonnen also addresses why many fans felt Song Yadong did enough to win, and why the decision was met with immediate pushback inside the arena. He compares this moment to other situations where elite fighters were handed difficult assignments with no obvious reward—something that has become a recurring test at the top of the sport. While Sonnen disagreed with the scorecards, he explains why this fight represented the ask—the moment when a champion is expected to accept danger without complaint. O’Malley did exactly that, survived a tough opponent, and still walked away with the victory. The question now is simple: what comes next for the UFC bantamweight division?
