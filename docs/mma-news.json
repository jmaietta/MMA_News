      "title": "I Was Wrong About Andrei Arlovski",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6YX9B3CAuc",
      "description": "If anything negative has ever been said about Andrei Arlovski, it deserves to be reconsidered. Arlovski was the heavyweight champion of the world and the face of the UFC at its peak. When others would have walked away, he kept competing. When the spotlight disappeared, he kept fighting. When the money dried up, the venues got smaller, and the cameras turned off — he still showed up. This isn’t a story about hype or branding. It’s a story about competition. From headlining UFC pay-per-views, to taking fights no one else would accept, to rebuilding his career after setbacks inside and outside the cage, Arlovski proved something rare: he wasn’t chasing fame — he was chasing fights. That truth was tested repeatedly: Losing the belt and losing momentum The collapse of Affliction after the loss to Fedor Emelianenko Fighting in small venues with no cameras Accepting impossible matchups simply because they were offered Returning to the UFC and staying there longer than almost anyone Battling and surviving stage-four cancer Becoming a bare-knuckle champion at 47 by defeating Ben Rothwell Andrei Arlovski didn’t endure because he was an athlete. He endured because he was a competitor. If there was ever doubt — it’s time to clear it up. ⏱️ CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — Clearing the Record Why past criticism of Andrei Arlovski deserves to be revisited. 0:41 — Arlovski at the Top of the UFC Heavyweight champion, main-event star, and the face of the company. 1:29 — Athlete vs Fighter Why being a great athlete isn’t an insult — and how toughness shows up later. 2:18 — Losing the Belt, Losing the Spotlight How momentum and marketing moved on after the title loss. 3:06 — The Affliction Era and Fedor Why the loss to Fedor looked like the end — and wasn’t. 3:58 — When the Cameras Turned Off Fighting in small venues, no TV, no hype — and still showing up. 4:45 — Accepting the Impossible Fight Why taking on Roy “Rumble” Johnson said everything about Arlovski’s mindset. 5:36 — The Long Road Back to the UFC How Arlovski rebuilt his career quietly and stayed relevant. 6:18 — Life Outside the Cage Cancer, survival, and fighting again after remission. 7:08 — Bare Knuckle at 47 Why beating Ben Rothwell without gloves completed the story. 8:02 — Final Reassessment Why Andrei Arlovski should be remembered as a true competitor.

      "title": "Biting an Ear in MMA: Rage, Quitting, or Something Else?",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRSzM8ynq_s",
      "description": "A recent MMA fight ended in chaos when a fighter intentionally bit his opponent’s ear — drawing immediate comparisons to Tyson–Holyfield and raising serious questions about intent, control, and professionalism. Credit to Ariel Helwani for first highlighting the incident and framing it as one of the most extreme moments the sport has seen in years. But this situation feels different. When Mike Tyson bit Evander Holyfield, the reason was clear: frustration, desperation, and an attempt to hurt an opponent who was winning within the rules. Other historical examples — including alleged incidents involving Matt Lindland — point to something else entirely: competitiveness so intense that it spills outside the rules in a bid to win. This incident doesn’t fit either category cleanly. It happened quickly. There was no prolonged dominance, no clear desperation, and no obvious moment that forced a choice between losing and cheating. That raises uncomfortable questions: Was this an attempt to injure? Was it a way out? Or was it a complete loss of emotional control? MMA has very few rules — which makes it essential that the ones that exist are respected. This isn’t about being prudish. It’s about professionalism, safety, and the responsibility fighters have when they step into a cage. The discussion also explores what should happen next: Rematch or permanent separation? Suspension or license revocation? Or a path back through accountability and discipline? There’s a reason every professional learns this lesson eventually: When the fight ends, the fight ends. ⏱️ CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — The Incident A shocking ear bite and immediate Tyson–Holyfield comparisons. 0:34 — Rage or Strategy? Is biting an attempt to hurt someone — or to escape a fight? 1:05 — Why Tyson’s Case Was Different Clear frustration, clear motive, clear loss inside the rules. 1:44 — The Lindland Example How extreme competitiveness can cross the line without quitting. 2:41 — Why This One Feels Different The speed, timing, and lack of desperation change the interpretation. 3:33 — Few Rules, Big Responsibility Why MMA’s limited rule set makes enforcement essential. 4:28 — Intent vs Outcome Why accidental fouls and intentional acts aren’t the same conversation. 5:22 — What Should the Consequence Be? Rematch, suspension, license removal, or something else? 6:15 — Losing Control After the Fight The psychological moment when adrenaline hasn’t shut off yet. 7:10 — Early MMA Lessons Why even legends had to learn professionalism the hard way. 8:04 — Final Rule The simplest rule of all: don’t bite someone’s ear.

      "description": "Jon Jones made major headlines after getting filmed saying he has severe arthritis he's dealing with. Daniel Cormier IS BACK to give his reaction to the viral video revealing Jon's injuries, and why \"it's a sad day\" to see Jones is finally doing fighting in the sport. DC GOES IN ON why he thinks there's NO WAY Jones will wrestle him after this news came out, and that we should get ready to now see the end of Jones' career in the UFC. See why Cormier thinks Jon is actually okay with the news coming out, despite his public comments claiming he didn't know he was being filmed. And with Justin Gaethje vs. Ilia Topuria almost certainly headlining the White House, DC gives his take on the future UFC title fight.

      "title": "George St-Pierre Says Ilia Topuria Could Be the GOAT — Here’s Why",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKz3Jd4b-X4",
      "description": "George St-Pierre believes Ilia Topuria could one day finish his career as the UFC’s undisputed greatest of all time. That’s enormous praise — especially coming from the man many consider the current GOAT. But what would that actually require? This discussion breaks down what “greatest of all time” really means in MMA, and why résumé counting alone doesn’t answer the question. From Topuria’s dominance at featherweight to the challenges awaiting him at lightweight, the conversation quickly becomes about how wins matter — not just how many. It also raises unavoidable comparisons: Is Topuria already the greatest featherweight ever? What separates greatness at 145 from greatness at 155? How do legends like Khabib Nurmagomedov, Islam Makhachev, and Alexander Volkanovski factor into the discussion? Can someone truly be the GOAT without facing their era’s defining rival? Longevity, dominance, adversity, and timing all matter — but there may be one path that settles the debate immediately. This isn’t about resumes. It’s about understanding what you’re watching. ⏱️ CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — GSP’s Prediction Why George St-Pierre’s praise of Ilia Topuria matters more than anyone else’s. 0:27 — What Does “GOAT” Actually Mean? Why greatness isn’t just a checklist of title defenses. 0:53 — Has Ilia Already Cleaned Out 145? The Volkanovski win and why the lack of a rematch matters. 1:36 — Is Ilia the Greatest Featherweight Ever? Why fans give that title to Volk — and what that implies for Ilia. 2:41 — Moving to 155: A Different Standard Why lightweight greatness is measured differently. 3:08 — Khabib, BJ Penn, and Dominance What Ilia would need to match or surpass at lightweight. 3:53 — The Islam Question Can Ilia be the GOAT if he and Islam never fight? 4:33 — Two Champions, Same Era Why Ilia and Islam’s parallel accomplishments complicate the argument. 5:06 — Losses, Timing, and Narrative How undefeated records and context influence legacy. 5:40 — Ilia Tried to Make the Fight Why intent and willingness matter in GOAT discussions. 6:33 — Why Résumés Aren’t Enough The difference between “best career” and “best fighter.” 7:26 — Longevity vs One Defining Win Five more fights — or one fight that ends the debate. 8:32 — Final Thought Why beating Islam right now may be the fastest path to GOAT status.

      "description": "This is not an accusation and it is not based on inside information. It’s a look at why the current situation surrounding Jon Jones doesn’t seem to add up. Jon Jones — the reigning heavyweight champion, undefeated at heavyweight, and widely regarded as one of the greatest fighters of all time — is currently absent from the rankings. At the same time, Jones has publicly discussed significant health issues, including hip problems and uncertainty about returning to competition. Historically, the MMA community has been given one clear reason why a signed fighter would be ineligible to be ranked. No second explanation has ever been formally presented. That gap raises questions — not conclusions. This discussion examines: How rankings eligibility has been explained in the past Why Jones’ résumé makes his absence difficult to reconcile Patterns the sport has seen before (without applying them here) The conflicting public signals surrounding Jones’ health and activity There is no claim being made that Jon Jones failed a drug test. In fact, if such information existed, this conversation would not be happening. The goal here is simple: Look at the facts as presented and ask whether they logically align. You decide what to make of it. Something Doesn’t Make Sense With the Jon Jones CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — Clear Disclaimer Why this is not an accusation and not based on inside information. 0:09 — The Rankings Don’t Add Up Why Jon Jones’ résumé makes his absence from the rankings hard to explain. 0:24 — Jones’ Health Statements Hip replacement, arthritis, and uncertainty about returning. 0:36 — The Only Known Reason Fighters Aren’t Ranked Why failing a drug test is the only established reason a signed fighter is excluded. 0:54 — No Second Explanation Has Ever Been Given Why the MMA community has never been offered an alternative rationale. 1:07 — A Pattern Seen Before How medical hardship stories have historically preceded failed test announcements (without applying that claim here). 1:23 — How Fighters Try to Bridge the Gap Why some athletes retroactively connect health issues to later test results. 2:10 — Medical Hardship vs Public Activity Why severe health claims raise questions when paired with visible athletic activity. 2:39 — No Inside Information Why this discussion would not exist if there were actual knowledge of a failed test. 3:00 — Conflicting Signals Hip replacement concerns, retirement uncertainty, and playing televised flag football. 3:24 — Is the Ranking Linked to the Situation? Why the timing creates confusion, not conclusions. 3:42 — The Only Exception Ever Cited Why behind-the-scenes dealings with the testing agency are the sole known exclusion. 3:55 — Final Question to the Audience Why viewers are asked to assess the facts for themselves.

      "title": "Does Failing a PED Test Disqualify Jon Jones From GOAT Status?",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhN09KxVCqQ",
      "description": "Coach Javier Mendez recently stated that Jon Jones should not be included in the GOAT discussion because of a failed PED test. That argument sounds reasonable — but it doesn’t settle the issue. The real question isn’t whether Jon Jones was the cleanest athlete of all time. It’s whether he was the greatest fighter of all time — and those are not the same conversation. Standards change. Rules evolve. Substances banned today may be permitted tomorrow, just as many things once allowed are now prohibited. Evaluating greatness across eras quickly becomes complicated. If given a choice — one fighter’s complete skill set, passed down to the next generation — most would choose Jon Jones. Not because of paperwork or testing history, but because of skill, adaptability, and dominance inside the cage. This discussion also raises broader questions: How do failed tests factor into legacy? Who decides when an asterisk applies? How should fighters from different eras be compared? Where do legends like Fedor Emelianenko and Khabib Nurmagomedov fit into the conversation? The conclusion is clear: Jon Jones may not be the cleanest fighter of all time — but failing a PED test does not disqualify him from being the greatest fighter of all time. CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — Javier Mendes’ Claim Why failing a PED test is being used to exclude Jon Jones from the GOAT discussion. 0:39 — Clean vs Greatest Why “cleanest fighter” and “greatest fighter” are two completely different conversations. 1:05 — Rules Change Over Time How banned substances, testing standards, and enforcement shift across eras. 1:38 — The Skill Test Thought Experiment If you could pass one fighter’s skills to the next generation, who would you choose? 2:27 — Does a Failed Test Require an Asterisk? Who decides legacy disqualification — fans, commissions, or history? 3:00 — Where Does Fedor Fit? Why fighters without UFC runs are often discounted — fairly or unfairly. 3:34 — Comparing Eras Is Inherently Flawed Why dominance in one era doesn’t translate cleanly to another. 4:13 — Fighters Who Used PEDs but Never Failed Why the discussion becomes a slippery slope when enforcement is inconsistent. 4:56 — Cleanest Fighter vs Greatest Fighter Why Jon Jones clearly fails one category but remains eligible for the other. 5:18 — GOAT vs “Greatest of His Time” Why this framing may be the most honest way to evaluate legacy. 5:59 — Final Verdict Why failing a PED test does not disqualify Jon Jones from GOAT consideration.

      "description": "Did Jon Jones just quietly walk away from the biggest fight of his career? Chael Sonnen reacts to a surprising interview where Jones revealed something we don’t normally hear from champions — severe arthritis in his hip. Not soreness. Not wear and tear. Severe arthritis. And for the first time in a long time, Jon wasn’t talking about fights, belts, or comebacks. He was talking about life after fighting. No mention of a White House supercard. No mention of competing. No big callouts. Instead, Jones talked about protecting what he has left physically and spending time playing with his son. That’s not the language of a guy gearing up for Alex Pereira or any mega-event. Then Pereira adds fuel to the fire, saying flat-out he won’t be fighting Jon Jones at the White House. Put it together, and Chael connects the dots: this might not be negotiation tactics. This might be reality. Jones may have just removed himself from contention entirely. If the dream superfight was ever going to happen… this could be the moment it died. Sometimes it’s not what a fighter says — it’s what they don’t say. #JonJones #AlexPereira #UFC #MMA #Heavyweight #ChaelSonnen #CombatSports #Superfight",

      "description": "The champ is back — and no, Chael Sonnen isn’t talking about himself. He’s talking about Ilia Topuria. Topuria returning means one thing: massive fights. And on paper, the biggest fight you can possibly make in the sport right now is simple — Ilia Topuria vs. Islam Makhachev. Champion vs. champion. Star vs. star. It sells itself. But Chael says pump the brakes. The UFC likely isn’t booking that unless Ilia gives up his belt or fully commits to lightweight. That’s a big sacrifice — and historically, the company doesn’t force those moves lightly. Which means the fight we think we’re getting… probably isn’t next. So what is? Enter Justin Gaethje. Chael argues we’ve disrespected Gaethje long enough. This isn’t just some action fighter — this is a true competitor. A guy who doesn’t wilt under pressure, doesn’t fold backstage, and definitely doesn’t fold in the cage. Skill for skill, toughness for toughness, Gaethje is a nightmare matchup for anyone — including Topuria. Ilia might be elite. But Justin is something different: proven chaos. If Islam isn’t next, Topuria vs. Gaethje might be the real superfight hiding in plain sight. #IliaTopuria #JustinGaethje #IslamMakhachev #UFC #MMA #Lightweight #ChaelSonnen #CombatSports",

      "description": "Jorge Masvidal just said something that stopped Chael Sonnen in his tracks — he called Ilia Topuria the Michael Jordan of MMA. Think about that. Masvidal didn’t just praise Topuria. He laid out a path to all-time greatness: move up, beat Islam Makhachev, grab a second belt, then chase a third at welterweight. If Ilia holds titles at 145, 155, and 170, Masvidal says you can’t deny him anymore. Not Jon Jones. Not Georges St-Pierre. Not Khabib. Nobody. Chael breaks down how crazy — and how realistic — this actually sounds. Because here’s the twist: Topuria might already be closer than people think. He’s the featherweight champ, he’s proven he can compete at lightweight, and he already owns the BMF title. The only reason he’s not technically a simultaneous multi-division champ? Paperwork and timing. Competition-wise, the skills are there. Power. Boxing. Confidence. Zero fear of moving up. Chael asks the real question: if Topuria beats Islam, does the GOAT debate instantly change? It sounds bold now… until it happens. Then it’ll sound obvious. #IliaTopuria #JorgeMasvidal #IslamMakhachev #UFC #MMA #GOAT #JonJones #GSP #Khabib #ChaelSonnen",

Terms: sportsbook.draftkings.com/promos. Ends 2/15/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Ilia Topuria has resolved significant personal matters and is preparing to return. Topuria confirmed that a divorce and settlement are now behind him — information he chose to share publicly, despite having no obligation to do so. While personal disclosures are uncommon, Topuria has consistently shown a willingness to be open with fans and media, even when uncomfortable. As champion, those expectations increase. Media appearances, scheduling obligations, and division momentum become part of the role. Throughout this period, Topuria maintained that he was not injured, but navigating a deeply personal situation involving family — a factor that previously played a central role in his public image. That chapter now appears closed. With it comes a shift. Financial realities change. Motivation evolves. The transition from wanting to fight to needing to fight is a real one in combat sports — and history has shown that such moments can redefine careers. There is a famous expression attributed to Marvin Hagler: “It’s hard to wake up in silk pajamas and go running at 5 a.m.” The point is not wealth — it’s urgency. And urgency has a way of sharpening focus. Topuria’s willingness to return quickly suggests resolution, not hesitation. While speculation around superfights persists, the reality remains unchanged: champions are expected to defend before moving on. For that reason, confidence is high that Ilia Topuria’s return will come against Justin Gaethje — not a divisional leap, and not a delay. This is not a setback story. This is a pivot. And by all indications, it’s a good day for the division.

      "description": "Khamzat Chimaev is doing something Chael Sonnen loves — he’s not letting Alex Pereira breathe. Callouts. Pressure. Constant noise. Chimaev keeps aiming straight at Pereira like a heat-seeking missile. And to Pereira’s credit? He’s not ducking anyone. He’s said it himself — big fights, hard fights, grapplers — he’ll take them all. There’s just one problem. They’re not even in the same weight class. Chael breaks down why this fight sounds great on social media but falls apart in reality. The UFC isn’t going to book it unless someone vacates a belt or completely changes divisions. That’s not a small ask — that’s a career-altering move. So how does Chimaev realistically get there? Meanwhile, Kamaru Usman throws fuel on the fire, questioning the rumors that Chimaev walks around at 230 pounds. If that’s even close to true, what division does he actually belong in? Middleweight? Light heavyweight? Something else entirely? It all creates chaos — but it’s fascinating chaos. Chael explains why Chimaev’s strategy is smart: stay loud, stay visible, force the company’s hand. Because sometimes in the UFC, the fight you get isn’t about rankings… it’s about pressure. And nobody applies pressure like Khamzat. #KhamzatChimaev #AlexPereira #UFC #MMA #KamaruUsman #Middleweight #LightHeavyweight #ChaelSonnen",

Michael Chandler is planning for June 14th — and he’s planning as if he will fight on a historic UFC card at the White House. In a phone call, Chandler made one thing clear: the opponent is irrelevant. Preparation is not. His focus is on being ready for the opportunity, regardless of who stands across from him on the South Lawn. The conversation also addressed the broader uncertainty surrounding the division, including: The continued ambiguity of Conor McGregor’s return Potential BMF title implications Justin Gaethje vs Paddy Pimblett Whether a future Ilia Topuria vs Islam Makhachev matchup belongs at 155 or 170 A common misconception continues to surface: fighters are not sitting on hidden knowledge. In most cases, they learn about matchups and title plans at the same time the public does. What separates Chandler is reliability. He is available, prepared, and unconcerned with narrative control — qualities that consistently place him at the center of major UFC moments.

      "description": "There’s dominant… and then there’s Alexander Volkanovski. Chael Sonnen makes a bold claim in this breakdown: no champion in the UFC has separated himself from the pack like Volk has right now. Not close fights. Not razor-thin decisions. We’re talking five-round shutouts. One judge literally gave him every single round. And here’s the scary part — the number one contender, the guy who beats everybody else in the division? He’s still five rounds worse. That’s not competitive. That’s a gap. Chael compares it to the all-time greats: Khabib Nurmagomedov, Georges St-Pierre, Jon Jones. Those guys had room to spare. They were so far ahead they could afford an off night and still win. Now Volkanovski is in that same rare air. Chael even floats the unthinkable: if Volk stopped training tomorrow — just stopped showing up — would anyone beat him in the next two years? Maybe not. Because that’s how far ahead he is technically, mentally, and strategically. While everyone else is chasing improvements, Volk is already operating at championship autopilot. This isn’t just a title reign. It’s separation. And separation is what creates legends. #AlexanderVolkanovski #UFC #MMA #Featherweight #Khabib #GSP #JonJones #ChaelSonnen",

Historically, that argument makes sense. For years, American wrestlers dominated mixed martial arts. But here’s the question no one is asking: Is the premise even true anymore? Are Eastern European wrestlers really dominating the UFC — or are we confusing Sambo, jiu-jitsu, and MMA-style grappling with Olympic wrestling? In this video, the idea gets broken down clearly: Why Khabib Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev don’t represent wrestling Why Georges St-Pierre may be the best wrestling-heavy MMA fighter ever — without wrestling The strange delay in signing Gable Steveson Why elite American wrestlers may not need MMA at all The question isn’t whether American wrestlers can dominate MMA. The real question is whether they should — and whether the problem even exists in the first place. 0:00 – Daniel Cormier Says He Has a Plan Cormier claims he knows how to bring American wrestlers back to MMA dominance. 0:39 – When American Wrestlers Ruled MMA A historically accurate look at the era when U.S. wrestlers “cleaned house.” 1:08 – Are Eastern Europeans Really Dominating?

The first step: signing American wrestlers. 3:17 – The Gable Steveson Situation Is Weird Why Gable Steveson hasn’t been signed yet. 3:35 – Is Wrestling Really Getting Beaten? Or is it simply not being given opportunities? 3:55 – You Don’t Just “Teach” Elite Wrestlers MMA Why the plan can’t be plug-and-play. 4:00 – The Names That Matter David Taylor, Kyle Dake, Jordan Burroughs, Spencer Lee — that tier of athlete. 4:16 – Why Elite Wrestlers Aren’t Interested World and Olympic dreams come first. 4:21 – The Money Problem in Wrestling Historically, MMA was the only real option. 4:40 – Bo Nickal as Proof of Concept Why Bo looks like a future UFC champion. 4:50 – Different Paths: Olympics vs MMA Why Dagestanis never pursued Olympic wrestling. 5:10 – Do We Even Need the American Wrestler?

Terms: sportsbook.draftkings.com/promos. Ends 2/15/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Former UFC champion Frankie Edgar floated an idea that instantly got the MMA world talking — not calling for retirement, but suggesting that Alexander Volkanovski consider leaving the sport on his own terms. Frankie’s point wasn’t disrespectful. It was reflective. Nobody ever truly gets to go out on top in this game. Fighters stay too long. They lose a step. The ending writes itself. Frankie simply asked: what’s wrong with walking away with your hand raised? Volkanovski has the money. He has the legacy. He has opportunities outside the Octagon. And yet, that’s never been enough for fighters wired like him. After his dominant performance, many expected a farewell. Instead, the bigger question remains — when do you actually call it? Is retirement about no longer being able to compete? Or no longer being able to win? The fighter doesn’t change overnight — only the result does. And that’s what makes this discussion uncomfortable. History tells us most legends don’t stop early. Volkanovski doesn’t seem built that way either. The question isn’t whether he can continue — it’s how long he should. Watch the full breakdown and decide for yourself. #UFC #AlexanderVolkanovski #FrankieEdgar #MMA #UFCNews #FightAnalysis 0:00 – Frankie Edgar Raises the Retirement Question Frankie suggests Volkanovski could retire — not a call, but a reflection. 0:32 – Why Nobody Ever Gets to Go Out on Top The brutal truth about fighters staying too long. 1:21 – The Belief Volkanovski Might Retire Why many thought Saturday night might be the end. 1:52 – Why the Rematch Never Made Sense A one-sided five-round fight and the oddity of an immediate rematch. 2:33 – How Rare a 5–0 Title Fight Really Is Why judges almost never score every round one way. 3:01 – When Do You Actually Call It? The real retirement question fighters can’t answer. 3:22 – Can You Still Compete but Not Be Champion? The uncomfortable middle ground most legends face. 3:23 – Ronda Rousey as the Warning Example When contracts, pay, and titles collide. 3:46 – What If Volkanovski Had Lost? Why the fighter wouldn’t be any different — only the result. 4:13 – Why Winning Changes the Retirement Narrative Same skills, same abilities, different public reaction. 4:27 – Volkanovski’s Personality and the “Bitter End” Why he doesn’t seem wired to walk away early. 4:34 – The Danger of Needing the Next Fight Why not having something to train for is concerning. 4:49 – Kicking the Can Down the Road Why fighters delay the inevitable as long as possible. 5:00 – Coach Lopez Says “Four More Fights” A realistic timeline emerges. 5:07 – The Likely Outcome in History Why this probably ends closer to four more fights than retirement.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/yI2DODE8tOE",
      "description": "Shavkat Rakhmonov is the clear number one contender at welterweight — 19 wins, 18 finishes, an absolute monster. But if you take him out of the picture, the entire division suddenly gets weird. Chael Sonnen lays out the problem. If Rakhmonov isn’t available, now what? Because there’s one guy you can’t ignore: Kamaru Usman. Love him or not, Usman isn’t going anywhere. Former champion, still elite, still relevant. Chael argues the path forward has to include him if you want legitimacy at 170. Then there’s the fresh blood. Ian Machado Garry vs. Michael Morales? That’s fireworks. Two young, undefeated (or near-undefeated) contenders, both dangerous, both rising fast. That’s the kind of fight that actually moves the division forward while the title picture sorts itself out. And then Chael throws out the wild one: Islam Makhachev at welterweight. The idea of Islam being the first man to take Usman down and hold him there sounds crazy… but would you watch it? Of course you would. Everybody would. That’s the state of 170 right now — contenders, legends, and chaos all colliding. If Rakhmonov’s sidelined, matchmaking just got very interesting. #ShavkatRakhmonov #KamaruUsman #IanGarry #MichaelMorales #IslamMakhachev #UFC #Welterweight #ChaelSonnen",
