      "description": "UFC 326 is set for Las Vegas and the BMF belt is on the line as Max Holloway defends against former lightweight champion Charles Oliveira in a highly anticipated rematch. Their first meeting in 2015 ended early due to injury, but both men are now veterans, champions, and among the most dangerous finishers in the sport. Holloway enters as the BMF champion and one of the greatest featherweights of all time, known for elite boxing, pace, and durability. Oliveira, the most prolific finisher in UFC history, brings dangerous submissions, knockout power, and relentless pressure. Both fighters are chasing one more run at undisputed gold — and a statement win here could change the title picture. Full breakdown of Holloway vs Oliveira 2, the BMF belt stakes, legacy implications, and the rest of the UFC 326 fight card. 🔒 Become a Member for special Perks, Exclusive Content and ultra-exclusive Live Chats: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrG2_1TcVkXKXXsD6Kjwig/join ▶️ Follow Michael on Social: https://www.instagram.com/mikebisping https://www.twitter.com/bisping https://www.facebook.com/mikethecountbisping ▶️ Edited by John Brannigan: https://www.instagram.com/johnbranniganuk https://www.twitter.com/johnbranniganuk #bisping #ufc #mma #mixedmartialarts #michaelbisping #ufcnews #mmanews #ufc326 #charlesoliveira #armantsarukyan #iliatopuria #maxholloway #justingaethje #paddypimblett",

      "description": "The middleweight division just got complicated. The manager for Khamzat Chimaev made it clear — they want the winner of Strickland vs Hernandez. Fair enough. Let the fight decide it. Well… it did. Sean Strickland wins. So is that the end of the debate? Not so fast. Nassourdine Imavov is still in the mix. And here’s the twist — Imavov’s last loss came against Strickland. If these two were neck-and-neck in the rankings, the head-to-head already gave us an answer. So what do you do? Option one: Strickland just became the clear number one contender and the obvious fight for Chimaev. Option two: Imavov quietly already has something lined up behind the scenes, and this is all optics. Option three: the UFC slows it down and lets the division breathe. But here’s what history says under the Ultimate Fighting Championship banner: when things are close, they let the cage decide. And the cage already spoke. Strickland thrives when doubted. Chimaev thrives on chaos. Stylistically, that’s pressure vs pressure. Cardio vs pace. Mental warfare vs relentless offense. The question isn’t who deserves it. The question is whether the UFC sees Strickland as the bigger moment. Because if he is… that fight gets made next.

      "description": "Eddie Hearn did the one thing you cannot do when dealing with Dana White. He called out “the boss.” After losing a top fighter to Zuffa Boxing, Eddie didn’t just lose the round — he questioned whether Dana answers to someone else. Chael explains why that’s a strategic error. Dana doesn’t shy away from battles. In fact, he wants resistance. He expected a fight when he made his move for Ben. Instead, he got signed paperwork. That disappointed him. But when Eddie publicly suggested Dana has a “daddy” — that’s not business. That’s personal. This isn’t about who’s right. It’s about understanding who you’re dealing with.

      "description": "When nobody believes in him, that’s when Sean Strickland is at his most dangerous. Strickland takes out Anthony Hernandez via TKO — and the story isn’t fatigue. It isn’t luck. It isn’t timing. It’s experience. Main event reps matter. Former champion composure matters. Strickland has been under the lights, in five-round fights, in championship rounds. When things get tense, he doesn’t rush. He doesn’t break. He leans into it. And here’s the pattern: when the world doubts him, when analysts question him, when fans write him off — he performs his best. No pressure. No expectation. Just execution. Hernandez is tough. Aggressive. Dangerous. But there’s a difference between being a contender and having championship seasoning. That gap showed up when it mattered most. So what now? Does Strickland jump back into title contention? Does he become the gatekeeper to the elite? Or does this performance put him right back in the middleweight championship picture under the Ultimate Fighting Championship banner? One thing is clear: if you count Sean Strickland out, you’re playing a risky game. And history says he thrives in that spot.

      "description": "There’s one thing I’m very confident about: Alex Pereira is going to be on the White House card. And I’m very confident it’s for a title. The real question isn’t if he fights. It’s where. Does Pereira defend at 205? Or does he move up and fight for the heavyweight championship? If Tom Aspinall isn’t ready — and all signs suggest that timeline is tight — then in theory the opportunity shifts toward Ciryl Gane. But here’s where it gets interesting. If we’re talking interim belt, does that really count in the history books? Does that carry the same weight? Does that headline a once-in-a-generation event? Because historically, when the UFC heavyweight title is contested under the Ultimate Fighting Championship banner, it closes the show. Always. The heavyweight championship doesn’t get placed underneath another fight. So if Pereira is on that card, and it’s for gold, logic says we’re not talking interim. We’re talking undisputed. That changes everything. A two-division champion moving up to heavyweight for undisputed gold? That’s legacy-defining. That’s the kind of moment that reshapes pound-for-pound debates and permanently alters a career. If this meeting produces news, don’t be surprised if it’s Pereira preparing for the biggest fight of his life — at heavyweight. Watch closely. This could be historic. #UFC #AlexPereira #Heavyweight #UFCTitle #TomAspinall #CirylGane #MMA #UFCNews #FightBusiness #CombatSports",

Different story... Chael breaks down: * Why relinquishing matters (like Ilia Topuria did) * Why holding two divisions hostage doesn’t help anyone * The White House card rumors * The possible heavyweight matchup with Ciryl Gane * The interim title scenario with Tom Aspinall sidelined If Pereira goes up — and Chael believes he will — he should relinquish.

      "description": "Get $10 Off at BRUNT with code CHAEL https://www.bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL at #Bruntpod There’s no debate anymore. Khamzat Chimaev must fight Sean Strickland next. Chael breaks down why this fight makes sense from every angle — rankings, integrity, entertainment, and the behind-the-scenes tension nobody wants to talk about. Strickland says he ran Khamzat out of the gym. Khamzat says he destroyed a man who beat Sean twice. That’s not just drama — that’s promotional gold. We also look at where Nassourdine Imavov fits in, the rumors about Khamzat walking around at 230 pounds, and why talk of 205 (and even calling out Alex Pereira and Jiri Prochazka) might signal something bigger. Plus: Sean Strickland is the Brunt Boot Athlete of the Week. If the UFC doesn’t book this fight next — what exactly are we doing?

Strickland was a meaningful underdog going in. But if you’ve followed his career, you know that’s when he does his best work. Doubt fuels him. Now the middleweight division is in a strange spot. We all believed Nassourdine Imavov was next for Khamzat Chimaev. It made sense. It felt lined up. But Chimaev’s manager said they’re watching the winner of Strickland vs. Hernandez. Well… Strickland won. Here’s the issue: Strickland already beat Imavov head-to-head. And in every sport in the world, head-to-head competition is the number one seeding criteria. So what does the UFC do now? Is Imavov already promised the shot? Or did Strickland just force himself back into contender status? Chael breaks it down. ⏱ TIMESTAMPS 0:00 – Strickland Stops Hernandez0:35 – Why Strickland Thrives as an Underdog1:40 – The Main Event Experience Advantage3:10 – Why Five Rounds Changes Everything4:20 – We Thought Imavov Was Next…5:10 – Chimaev’s Camp Changes the Narrative6:00 – The Head-to-Head Problem7:05 – Does Strickland Deserve the Shot?8:10 – What the UFC Will Actually Do Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "This wasn’t about hype. It wasn’t about clout. It was about escalation — and how fast it can go wrong. When Dean “The Great” stepped into an altercation with Tiki Ghosn, things crossed a line quickly. Words turned into threats. And once someone tells you they’re about to harm you, the situation changes. Here’s what most people missed. Tiki didn’t throw wild punches. He didn’t unload with bare hands. He chose an elbow — fast, direct, controlled. In a street setting, with no wraps and no gloves, a full-force punch can do serious damage to both people. An elbow ends it immediately. It’s aggressive, yes — but it’s decisive. And decisive matters. Even more important? Dean apologized afterward. That part says a lot. Because once you threaten someone physically — especially someone older, experienced, and trained — you force a response. At that point, it’s no longer posturing. It’s self-defense. This wasn’t about winning. It was about stopping something before it got worse. There’s a lesson here about ego, escalation, and understanding who you’re dealing with before things go too far. In fight culture, respect still matters — and so does accountability.

      "description": "The biggest debate in fight business right now isn’t who wins in the cage — it’s who sells the most outside of it. When you compare Ilia Topuria and Islam Makhachev, you’re talking about dominance vs momentum, legacy vs surge, and global reach vs breakout star power. Right now, Islam has the resume, title defenses, and long-term dominance that traditionally builds superstars inside the Ultimate Fighting Championship. He represents stability at the top, elite skill, and championship consistency — things that historically translate to main event trust from promoters. But Ilia is something different. He’s momentum. He’s highlight finishes. He’s personality plus performance. And in modern fight sports, viral moments, confidence, and crossover appeal can accelerate star power fast. The danger in booking them too early is simple: one loses momentum, and the company usually protects rising draws carefully. The real answer might be simpler than people think. Put them on the same card. Whoever headlines is the bigger commercial star at that moment. That’s how fight business has always worked. Until that happens, this debate stays theoretical. But if they ever share a card, the promotion will tell you exactly who moves the needle more.

      "description": "The fight world might be looking at this the wrong way. The real story isn’t celebrity crossover. The real story is Jake Paul stepping into the MMA business — and possibly doing it with real distribution power behind him. This isn’t about one big spectacle fight. This is about infrastructure. If Jake Paul is working alongside Netflix while exploring MMA, that changes how fights are delivered, marketed, and consumed. The traditional model built by Ultimate Fighting Championship is based on event stacking, rankings, and title pathways. Jake’s model historically focuses on big moments, viral matchups, and crossover audiences. If that approach enters MMA full-time, it could mean fewer “filler fights” and more event-driven super fights. It could also create bidding wars for talent and completely reshape how fighters negotiate paydays and exposure. That’s the part people aren’t talking about yet — but fighters, managers, and promoters definitely are. The takeaway is simple: if this moves from big fight business into actual MMA promotion territory, the landscape shifts overnight. Not someday. Immediately. Watch this closely. The next 12 months could redefine how fight fans watch MMA forever.

      "description": "Alex Pereira is walking around at 242 pounds. That’s not rumor — that’s what he says he weighs when he’s training. So what does that mean? Is Pereira fighting at light heavyweight at the White House? Or is he moving to heavyweight? And if he moves — is it for the interim belt… or the undisputed belt? Because if it’s not undisputed, does it even count toward champ-champ-champ status? There’s a reason Pereira isn’t mentioning certain names.There’s a reason heavyweight keeps coming up. And there’s a reason Jon Jones talk may finally be over. If Pereira fights for the heavyweight title at the White House… that changes everything. ⏱ TIMESTAMPS 0:00 Pereira at 242 Pounds1:05 White House Title Fight?2:00 Light Heavyweight or Heavyweight?3:05 What He’s NOT Saying4:10 Why Olberg’s Name Matters5:05 Champ Champ Champ Debate6:20 Interim Belt vs Undisputed7:30 The Jon Jones Question8:45 Nick Diaz Marketing Example10:15 Would Interim Even Count?11:30 Why This Would Main Event12:20 Is Pereira Fighting Undisputed?

IVs in their arms. Cornermen surrounding them.

Dean was already in a tense spot. Then he stepped to Tiki. He got in his face. He said he’d slap him. He said he’d do it right now. They were inches apart. At that distance, there’s only two choices: Defend yourself — or be a fool. Tiki chose to defend himself. But here’s the part that matters… Dean owned it. He apologized. He admitted he started it. He said they were good. That’s rare.
