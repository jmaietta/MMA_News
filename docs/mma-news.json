Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. A video of Shavkat Rakhmonov surfaced recently, and if you’ve seen it, you know why people are concerned. This wasn’t trash talk or bravado — it was hard to watch, and it raised real questions about what’s been happening behind the scenes. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains the quiet timeline of Rakhmonov’s injuries, including what now appears to be a second knee surgery and why that matters. After his fight with Stephen Thompson, the story was unclear. Achilles? Foot? Ankle? Then after going the distance for the first time against Ian Garry, the narrative shifted to a compromised knee — but nothing was ever confirmed publicly. Now, with Rakhmonov potentially sidelined another 9–10 months, the entire welterweight division is forced to move forward without its clear number one contender. That raises major questions about what comes next for Islam Makhachev, Kamaru Usman, Michael Morales, and how Ian Garry fits into the picture. This isn’t speculation for clicks — it’s about understanding the reality of injuries, timelines, and opportunity in the UFC. Most importantly, it’s about recognizing what Rakhmonov has dealt with quietly and why the division looks completely different right now.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VOMWKoXBDI",
      "description": "The retirement talk around Alexander Volkanovski doesn’t match reality — and his coach just made that clear. After the fight, Volkanovski’s coach spoke openly about camp, injuries, and the future, including a shoulder issue serious enough that they considered pulling out of the fight. This wasn’t adrenaline or hype. It was an honest assessment, and it came with a surprising statement: they believe Volkanovski still has four more fights in him. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains why the idea of Volkanovski retiring now doesn’t add up. Yes, he’s fought at home. Yes, he’s broken records. Yes, he’s cemented his legacy. But Volkanovski has also been transparent about something else — free time is not good for him. He needs structure, goals, and competition. Walking away doesn’t solve that. Great champions face this moment differently. Some leave on top, like Khabib Nurmagomedov. Others keep competing because that’s who they are. Volkanovski fits the second category. The most important part? The gap. One judge scored the fight five rounds to none. Volkanovski could fight worse than he did Saturday and still be better than the rest of the division. That level of separation is rare — and it means retirement isn’t imminent. Four fights doesn’t sound crazy. It sounds realistic.

In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen walks through the logic behind Alexander Volkanovski vs Diego Lopes and why the rematch raises more questions than answers. Especially now that Ilia Topuria vs Lerone Murphy has been announced as the next main event. Traditionally, title contenders don’t fight each other — one of them beats the former number-one contender to earn the shot. That’s not what happened here. Lopes received a title opportunity, lost every round on at least one scorecard, and now the division is left trying to figure out what that performance actually means. If Lopes truly earned the title shot, the rankings should reflect it. If he didn’t, then why did the UFC make the fight in the first place? That’s not criticism — it’s curiosity. Rankings are supposed to tell us who can beat the field and who can challenge the champion. Right now, the featherweight picture feels blurry. And I’m genuinely trying to figure out what I missed.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Benoît Saint Denis called for a BMF title shot — and while there’s no questioning how tough he is, that doesn’t automatically make him eligible. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains why Benoît Saint Denis does not qualify for a BMF title fight right now, even though he is undeniably one of the most dangerous fighters in the sport. This isn’t about skill, toughness, or courage — Saint Denis has all of that. The issue is what the BMF title has always represented. Chael revisits the origins of the BMF belt, starting with Jorge Masvidal vs Nate Diaz, and Dana White’s explanation that “you’ll know it when you see it.” The BMF isn’t a rankings-based award. It’s built on longevity, reputation, willingness, short-notice fights, and earning respect over time from the MMA community. That’s why fighters like Max Holloway belong in that conversation — and why Saint Denis, despite being a legitimate bad dude, simply hasn’t been around long enough yet. This isn’t an insult. It’s the opposite. Saint Denis is on the path — just not at the destination. And if the BMF title starts ignoring its own standards, it loses what makes it special.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Paddy Pimblett took a shot at Dan Hooker, then casually floated Benoît Saint Denis as his next matchup — and that’s where things stopped making sense. In this clip, Chael Sonnen breaks down Paddy Pimblett’s recent comments, including why dismissing Dan Hooker after a loss may actually work against him in the UFC’s matchmaking system. Paddy suggested Hooker is no longer relevant because he lost — but Paddy himself is coming off a loss, which complicates the logic. If anything, that result may make the Hooker fight more likely, not less. Chael also dives into the Benoît Saint Denis situation and explains why that matchup doesn’t clearly benefit Paddy at this stage. Saint Denis has been calling out nearly everyone in the top five, including Charles Oliveira, Max Holloway, Ilia Topuria, Justin Gaethje, and Arman Tsarukyan — a strategy that creates confusion rather than momentum. The real takeaway? Callouts matter, but clarity matters more. Fighters need their fans and momentum moving in one direction, and right now neither Paddy Pimblett nor Benoît Saint Denis has made it clear what fight actually advances them. Watch the full breakdown and decide for yourself which fight makes the most sense next.

      "description": "When Chael Sonnen calls someone “terrible,” it isn’t always an insult. In this breakdown, Chael explains why Tai Tuivasa embodies a rare quality that can’t be coached, drilled, or earned through belt levels: pure toughness. At heavyweight, Chael argues, there’s a point where skill acquisition hits a ceiling and fighters must operate within the limits of their bodies. Tai lives in that reality — and embraces it. Chael compares Tuivasa to fighters like Derrick Lewis and even a modern-day Tank Abbott, emphasizing that Tai isn’t a technician off his back or a jiu-jitsu specialist. He’s a cage fighter. A street fighter. And that’s not a flaw — it’s his identity. Despite questioning himself early in the fight and finding himself in bad positions, Tuivasa never chose the easy way out. Chael breaks down how many fighters quietly quit through positional surrender — and why Tai simply doesn’t know how to do that. Instead, he fought through exhaustion, adversity, and doubt, finding his way back to his feet and back into the fight. Even in defeat, Chael believes Tuivasa discovered something important: he’s tougher, more competitive, and more capable than he realized. And in heavyweight MMA, that may be the rarest commodity of all.

In this breakdown, Chael reacts to the performance of Oon Elliott, focusing not on technique or tactics, but on something far more difficult to measure: willingness. Chael explains how fights are often decided not by skill, but by a moment where one athlete separates from their desire to continue — even for a single second. According to Chael, Elliott didn’t lose because he quit. He lost because he got caught in a position — and even then, he never stopped fighting. He never surrendered. He went all the way to sleep still trying to escape. Chael also breaks down why early submissions can happen, how sweat and friction change outcomes in MMA, and why the same fight might not produce the same result twice. He points to the pressure of media obligations, expectations, and career stakes — and why Elliott handled all of it the right way. If Chael had to choose one fighter from the card based purely on will, sacrifice, and competitive spirit, his answer is clear. This is why Oon Elliott earned Chael Sonnen’s respect.

      "description": "You can go to my partner https://kalshi.com/chael and get $10 when you trade $100. Dan Hooker didn’t get outclassed — and Chael Sonnen explains exactly why. In this breakdown, Chael reacts to the finish between Dan Hooker and Benoît Saint-Denis, pushing back on the idea that Hooker fought poorly. According to Chael, this wasn’t a case of someone getting beaten up — it was a single positional exchange that ended the fight. Chael explains how Hooker’s evolution against elite wrestlers changed everything, pointing to his confidence, his offensive wrestling, and his willingness to initiate grappling exchanges. Rather than avoiding wrestling, Hooker attacked — using underhooks, body locks, and forward pressure — which Chael describes as the ultimate form of wrestling defense. The breakdown also dives into “anti-wrestling,” why offensive grappling creates defensive safety, and how Saint-Denis smartly shifted away from pure wrestling into judo-style techniques to capitalize on the moment. Chael gives Saint-Denis full credit for the finish, while making it clear that Hooker’s performance was one of his best — even if the result doesn’t reflect it. This is a reminder that MMA isn’t always about who fought better — sometimes it’s about who won a single position.

In this episode, Chael Sonnen breaks down the confusion surrounding the Volk vs Lopes rematch — and why he never fully understood how it got booked in the first place. Chael reacts to the explanation floating around the MMA world (including commentary from Ariel Helwani), then explains why “rewards” for taking fights don’t apply the way people think in this case. He also clears up a major judging misconception: a knockdown does not automatically win a round in the UFC, and he gives a real example to prove it. From there, Chael highlights what made the rematch more competitive than the first fight — while still arguing that the division had clearer contenders. He points to Lerone Murphy and Movsar Evloev as names that made more sense, and explains why the UFC doesn’t book “curtain call” fights based on secret retirement plans. Finally, Chael gives Volkanovski major credit: his pace, his durability, and how close he came to doing something historic — including his competitive showing against Islam Makhachev. Chael also touches on records and legacy, referencing **Jose Aldo, and why Volk keeps choosing the hardest possible path.

      "description": "Is Arman Tsarukyan the hottest name in MMA right now? Chael Sonnen thinks he might be — and it’s not even close. Tsarukyan isn’t just winning fights. He’s winning attention. Headlines. Clicks. Momentum. Somehow, he’s generating more buzz than Ilia Topuria — and Topuria’s a world champion. From dominant performances to viral moments (yes, even the food challenges), Arman has turned himself into must-watch content without even fighting. But here’s where it gets interesting. Tsarukyan came out and said if there’s a logjam at lightweight, fine — he’ll just drop to featherweight and fight for that belt instead. No begging. No waiting. No politics. Just opportunity hunting. Chael breaks down why that mindset is dangerous for the rest of the division. We’ve seen pushback before when champs or contenders move up. Even Topuria had to “prove himself” at 155. Khabib Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev weren’t quick to hand out opportunities. But Arman’s playing this differently — he’s publicly showing he doesn’t care who says no. And that confidence? That’s leverage. When a guy is willing to fight anybody, anywhere, any weight — the UFC usually finds a way to say yes. Is Tsarukyan about to force his way into a title shot… or even two divisions?",

      "description": "I’m not overthinking this one — I’m taking Alexander Volkanovski. Chael Sonnen breaks down the rematch with Diego Lopes and makes a simple point: they already fought, and there was nothing controversial about it. Five clear rounds. Dominant. Decisive. Volk controlled the pace, the pressure, and the fight from start to finish. So why are people suddenly acting like this is a toss-up? Yes, Lopes hits hard. And yes, power is always the great equalizer. Chael admits that’s the one danger — because the only times we’ve seen Volkanovski lose, it came from someone landing something big. But beating Volk isn’t just about power. It’s about matching — and exceeding — his pace for 25 minutes. That’s a different problem entirely. Very few fighters in the world can even attempt that. Islam Makhachev did. Most can’t. Ilia Topuria didn’t match the pace — he just found the shot. That’s lightning in a bottle, not a strategy. If Lopes is going to win, it has to be with one punch. Because round after round? That’s Volkanovski’s world. Sometimes the smart pick is the obvious one.",

Arman thinks that they won’t give Paddy hard fights because they don’t want to ruin his stardom as he rises through the ranks of the lightweight division.

      "description": "You can go to my partner https://kalshi.com/chael and get $10 when you trade $100. Colby Covington calling out Paddy Pimblett wasn’t on anyone’s bingo card — but Chael Sonnen doesn’t hate it. In this breakdown, Chael reacts to Colby Covington calling out Paddy Pimblett for a potential White House card. It’s a matchup that crosses weight classes, rankings, and expectations — which is exactly why Chael finds it interesting. Chael explains why cross-division callouts usually don’t happen, why fans love them when they do, and how this fight could actually benefit Paddy at a crucial moment in his career. After tasting title-fight attention, most fighters want one thing: to get back. A fight with Covington would instantly deliver relevance, spotlight, and pressure relief — even if it means stepping outside Paddy’s natural division. The conversation also touches on the criticism surrounding Paddy’s last performance, Colby’s blunt assessment, and why chaos fights sometimes arrive at the perfect time. Chael shares behind-the-scenes insight, including why Bo Nickal and Colby might be circling each other — and why momentum, not rankings, often drives these moments. Is it realistic? Maybe not. Is it fascinating? Absolutely. And that’s why Chael Sonnen loves talking about it.

      "description": "It’s time for Ask Uncle Chael — and Chael Sonnen doesn’t dodge the hard questions. In this wide-ranging Q&A, Chael weighs in on the greatest talkers in pro wrestling history, explaining why the debate ultimately comes down to The Rock versus Stone Cold Steve Austin, and why their greatness came from very different strengths. Chael also shares blunt thoughts on legacy names like Ric Flair and Dusty Rhodes — and why nostalgia sometimes rewrites history. The discussion then shifts to modern combat sports. Chael addresses growing speculation around Colby Covington versus Bo Nickal, confirming real interest behind the scenes and explaining why the matchup makes sense — especially in the context of a potential White House card. One of the most revealing moments comes when Chael reacts to comments from Kevin Lee about losing competitive drive after watching Ilia Topuria train and rise. Chael relates deeply, explaining how seeing the next generation surpass your ceiling can be one of the hardest realities in sport. Chael also gives shine to underappreciated wrestlers from his own era, offers behind-the-scenes insight into RFA, and weighs whether a Justin Gaethje vs Ilia Topuria clash belongs on the White House stage. No scripts. No soft answers. Just perspective earned the hard way.

      "description": "You can go to my partner https://kalshi.com/chael and get $10 when you trade $100. Chael Sonnen tells a story about watching a near-perfect post-fight promo on UFC Fight Pass — and then watching the fighter take one fatal detour. While traveling and watching fights, Chael sees a lightweight grab the mic with a polished, rehearsed message that somehow sounds natural. The delivery is smooth. The structure is right. There’s even a clear call-to-action aimed directly at Dana White: “Get your checkbook.” Then it goes sideways. Chael explains why teasing or “attacking the boss” is the quickest way to sabotage your own opportunity — especially when you’re trying to get hired by the very people you’re calling out. The moment goes viral, MMA media piles on, and Dana White responds publicly with the harsh truth: if you’re going to cut a promo like that, you’d better have just had a great fight — and this wasn’t one. Chael breaks down what worked, what didn’t, and the real lesson for fighters: save the big promo for the moment you’ve earned it… and get better advisers.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVfbEPGuNdM",
      "description": "Dan Hooker versus Benoît Saint Denis looks explosive on paper — but according to Chael Sonnen, the matchup heavily favors Hooker. While many fans expect Saint Denis to drag this fight to the ground, Chael explains why that game plan may not be realistic, especially over three rounds. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen walks through the key stylistic clash between Dan Hooker and Benoît Saint Denis, focusing on output, durability, and where each fighter is most dangerous. Saint Denis brings pressure, power, and endurance — but beating Hooker requires something very specific: overwhelming grappling control. And that’s where Chael sees the problem. Hooker is comfortable on the feet, hard to hurt, and no longer the vulnerable wrestler many fans remember from earlier in his career. After battles with elite grapplers, Hooker has proven he can survive bad positions, keep output high, and turn adversity into momentum. In a three-round fight, Chael believes those traits matter more than ever. This is a classic endurance matchup, but when championship rounds are taken off the table, Chael argues the advantage shifts decisively. Expect exchanges, pressure, and moments — but don’t be surprised if Hooker’s pace and comfort in chaos make the difference. Watch the full breakdown and hear why Chael Sonnen is confidently backing Dan Hooker.
