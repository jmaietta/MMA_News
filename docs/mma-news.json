In this episode of Ask Uncle Chael, Chael Sonnen tackles some of the most persistent questions MMA fans still argue about today. Did he really not know the rules in the Anderson Silva fight? What was Jon Jones actually like behind the scenes on The Ultimate Fighter? And who was the toughest opponent Chael ever faced that nobody talks about? Chael also breaks down why elite wrestlers so often struggle when they transition to MMA — and explains the single technical mistake that separates wrestlers who succeed in the cage from those who don’t. Later, he revisits the infamous Jon Jones toe injury and shares exactly what was going through his mind in that moment — including whether that fight could have ended differently. This isn’t revisionist history or internet mythology. It’s first-hand insight, told with honesty, humor, and the kind of perspective only a former title challenger can offer. If you’ve ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes, how fighters think in the heat of competition, or why fans so often misunderstand what they’re watching — this one’s for you.

Terms: sportsbook.draftkings.com/promos. Ends 2/15/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. A simple Google search led to one of the most misunderstood narratives in MMA history. Chael Sonnen tells the story of how a routine request from Misha Parsons uncovered four bizarre search questions — including one that would eventually shape his entire public persona. From whether tickling is legal in the UFC, to starting MMA at 27, to the only 17-year-old ever to compete in the promotion, Chael answers them all. But the final question — about his testosterone levels — opens the door to something much bigger. For the first time in detail, Chael explains how a false narrative spread, why defending himself only made it worse, and how he learned a brutal truth about public perception: explaining is losing. This isn’t a story about PEDs. It’s a story about psychology, media, and how reputations are formed. Chael breaks down how a single misleading claim, amplified at the wrong time by the wrong outlet, became the foundation for “The Bad Guy” character — not by design, but by survival. It’s a rare look behind the curtain at how fighters are shaped not just by wins and losses, but by headlines, silence, and restraint. Sometimes the smartest move… is not to fight back. #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMAHistory #TheBadGuy #CombatSports #MediaNarratives #UFCLegends Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Terms: sportsbook.draftkings.com/promos. Ends 2/15/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Ilia Topuria is back — and this time, the timing matters. Not a rumor. Not speculation. His own words. Chael Sonnen breaks down what Ilia’s return window really means, why April and June aren’t accidental, and how the UFC’s recent moves quietly rule out one mega-fight while opening the door to another. For months, Ilia Topuria has been exact with his messaging. Every announcement, every pivot, every delay has proven accurate — even when details were scarce. Now he says he’s ready to fight immediately, and that changes everything. The biggest fight the UFC could make is Ilia Topuria vs. Islam Makhachev. But Chael explains why that fight isn’t happening next, what the company has already decided behind the scenes, and why Justin Gaethje suddenly becomes the most logical opponent. This breakdown also addresses the uncomfortable truth fans don’t want to hear: Conor McGregor is no longer central to the board. Whether due to weight, timing, or leverage, Chael explains why the chess piece may be gone entirely — and why that matters for the White House card. If Ilia is returning, someone dangerous is waiting. And this isn’t about hype — it’s about competition. Watch closely. The clues are all there.

On the surface, it looks like a budget decision. In reality, it’s a warning sign. Chael Sonnen explains why this move has far bigger implications than one school or one sport. The NIL era was created to fix a real problem—the NCAA keeping massive revenues while athletes received nothing. That imbalance needed correction. But the current system has created a new one. Money is now being funneled almost entirely into football and men’s basketball. Olympic sports—the very programs that develop discipline, sacrifice, and long-term excellence—are being cut to make room. Wrestling is just one of the first casualties. Sonnen lays out a perspective rarely discussed: Olympic sports matter at a national level. Countries take Olympic performance seriously because it reflects something deeper—discipline, resilience, and the ability of young people to train, sacrifice, follow instruction, and succeed under pressure. That same age group, those same qualities, are what nations quietly measure through Olympic competition. And here’s the part many people miss: Olympic athletes do not come from training centers. They come from universities. The NCAA system feeds freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, track and field, gymnastics, and other Olympic disciplines. When college programs disappear, the pipeline collapses. This isn’t nostalgia. It’s infrastructure. Cal Baptist’s decision highlights a growing trend. Olympic sports are being stripped away not because they failed—but because the system around them changed. If this continues, the damage won’t show up immediately. It will show up years later, when the pipeline is gone and can’t be rebuilt. #Wrestling #NIL #NCAA #OlympicSports #CollegeWrestling #ChaelSonnen #CombatSports #USAOlympics Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Chael Sonnen believes there is exactly one fighter guaranteed a spot on the UFC White House card: Michael Chandler. Not because of rankings. Not because of wins. But because of loyalty, patience, and timing. If Chandler loses to Conor McGregor, the UFC will want to reward him. Red Panty Night is real, and Chandler earned that opportunity the hard way. He went through The Ultimate Fighter. He waited. He stayed quiet while dates, fights, and promises were dangled in front of him. Through it all, he remained a reliable company guy—and that matters more than people realize. What’s changed is the conversation. For the first time, Chandler publicly spoke about a fight that didn’t involve Conor McGregor. Instead, he talked about the BMF title and specifically mentioned Max Holloway. He even predicted Holloway would beat Charles Oliveira—then made it clear he had his eye on that belt. That omission matters. Chandler has always talked about Conor, even when preparing for other opponents. This time, Conor wasn’t mentioned at all. Behind the scenes, things have gone quiet. McGregor’s suspension paused the conversation. Then came comments about contracts, phone calls with Ari Emanuel, and uncertainty about timelines. After doing the legwork, Sonnen says this isn’t public negotiation or chess—it’s distance. The Chandler vs. McGregor fight isn’t happening. So what do you do with Chandler? Big fights are still available. A BMF matchup fits his profile. And regardless of opponent, Sonnen is confident Chandler won’t just be on the White House card—he’ll be on the main card. The only remaining question is who stands across from him. #UFC #MichaelChandler #ConorMcGregor #BMFTitle #MaxHolloway #MMA #FightBusiness #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

In a recent conversation, Jones turned down a proposed wrestling match with Daniel Cormier under the Real American Freestyle banner. That part alone isn’t shocking. What caught attention was the explanation. Jones said he has severe arthritis in his hip and qualifies for a hip replacement. He admitted his last two training camps were a struggle and made it clear that what he has left physically matters to him—especially with a young son at home. Officially, all Jones did was decline a wrestling match. But if the explanation is taken at face value, it raises a larger question. If Jones cannot wrestle because of his hip, what does that say about MMA? Wrestling is foundational to mixed martial arts, and the statement inevitably leads people to wonder whether Jones is still physically able—or willing—to compete at the highest level. The timing matters. Alex Pereira recently said he would not be fighting Jon Jones at the White House event, and Jones himself made no mention of fighting in this interview. Notably, he also made no reference to the White House at all—something he had consistently done in prior appearances. There is another interpretation. Jones may simply be preserving what he has left for one final MMA run and refusing to spend it on a wrestling camp. Arthritis doesn’t automatically mean surgery, and declining one competition doesn’t equal stepping away from another. Still, the silence is new. The absence of callouts is new. And the emphasis on life after fighting is new. Taken together, it’s fair to ask whether Jon Jones just quietly removed himself from the White House conversation—without ever saying the words. #JonJones #UFC #DanielCormier #AlexPereira #MMA #FightBusiness #CombatSports #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Waldo Cortes-Acosta floated an idea that stopped me in my tracks: it might be time for an interim heavyweight title. And the more you look at the current landscape, the harder it is to dismiss. The UFC has no clear parameters for when a champion must defend. Boxing does. Pro wrestling used to. Even other sports have timelines. But at heavyweight, we’re operating without a clock. Tom Aspinall is the undisputed champion, injured in the Octagon, and that matters. If anyone deserves patience, it’s him. This isn’t about stripping Tom. It’s about keeping the division moving while he heals. The problem is clarity. We don’t know how long Aspinall will be out, and we don’t know what the plan is. Holding everything for a Ciryl Gane rematch might sound logical, but timing matters. That first fight was the lowest-performing pay-per-view of the year, and momentum fades fast. Waiting another four or five months doesn’t help anyone—especially the rest of the division. Here’s the bigger issue: who exactly would even fight for an interim belt? Interim titles usually exist to justify massive, unavoidable fights. At heavyweight, that fight doesn’t obviously exist. Outside of a handful of names—and one undefeated wrestler, Josh Hockett—the division is thin. Wrestling, the most dominant skill set in MMA history, is nearly absent at heavyweight right now. Waldo’s idea isn’t wrong. It’s just incomplete. An interim belt only works if there’s a fight worthy of it. And that’s the question nobody’s answering. Watch the full breakdown and decide whether heavyweight needs an interim champion—or a complete reset. #UFC #Heavyweight #TomAspinall #InterimTitle #MMA #FightBusiness #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Masvidal recently said Ilia Topuria is the Michael Jordan of MMA—and then doubled down. He explained that if Topuria were to move up, beat Islam Makhachev, and hold championships at multiple weights, there would be no debate left. No Jon Jones. No Georges St-Pierre. No Khabib Nurmagomedov. Everyone else moves back. That’s a massive statement, and it deserves to be examined carefully. In this breakdown, I explain why Masvidal’s comparison isn’t just hype. Competition-wise, Ilia Topuria is already doing things we’ve almost never seen. He’s beaten Alexander Volkanovski. He’s finished Charles Oliveira. And while paperwork and timing matter in this sport, they don’t erase what’s happening inside the cage. I also explore the counter-argument. Do we really know enough yet? Beating Islam Makhachev isn’t like beating anyone else. The wrestling pressure, conditioning, and composure at 155 are different. And the lightweight title picture is complicated, with Arman Tsarukyan still looming and recent championship changes raising fair questions. To settle it, I asked fighters behind the scenes—former champions, contenders, peers. The answer was unanimous. Yes, Ilia Topuria is that good. Yes, we’ve seen enough. And no, there isn’t some hidden boogeyman waiting to expose him. The way you’re talked about behind your back matters. And right now, Ilia Topuria’s peers are saying something rare.

Conor McGregor has made something clear: before he returns to the UFC, he wants a direct conversation with Ari Emanuel—and he’s done talking through Dana White. That may sound dramatic, but when you dig into it, it’s not unreasonable at all. The UFC McGregor left years ago is not the UFC that exists today. The business model has changed. Pay-per-view points are no longer what they used to be, main events are no longer automatic, and even Conor’s contract structure was built around one assumption—that he headlines. Every time. So before committing to another massive event, McGregor wants clarity. Not hype. Not promises. Numbers. This breakdown explores what that call would actually be about: money, placement, guarantees, and whether Conor McGregor would ever accept a non–main event role. Because once you give up that top spot, you don’t get it back. Ever. Especially if you’re not holding a belt. We also look at how rare pay-per-view exceptions are, why fighters are sometimes paid to not fight elsewhere, and how Conor’s past leverage tactics compare to today’s landscape. This isn’t about ego—it’s about leverage in a business that’s changed underneath him. If Conor fights again, this call happens first. And what’s said on that call will tell us everything about where he really stands. Watch the full breakdown and decide what you think that conversation sounds like. #UFC #ConorMcGregor #AriEmanuel #DanaWhite #MMA #FightBusiness #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnenchBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Brown came out and said he wouldn’t pick Paddy Pimblett against anyone in the top 10—and maybe not even 11 or 12. That’s a strong statement, and it deserves a closer look. Yes, Paddy didn’t look great in that fight. Nobody’s arguing that. But judging a fighter’s entire ceiling off one performance—especially their first five-round, title-level main event—is dangerous. MMA changes when you change the rules. A five-round fight isn’t the same sport as a three-round fight, and history proves that over and over again. We’ve seen elite fighters look flat under the lights before. We saw it with Max Holloway against Alexander Volkanovski. We’ve seen wars like Dan Henderson vs Shogun Rua that weren’t technical masterpieces—but winning mattered more than polish. Skill doesn’t always look pretty, and sometimes survival is the skill. Paddy has positions where he’s dangerous. If he gets on top, he can change a fight. Does that specific performance beat the top 10? Maybe not. But judging the full body of work tells a different story. Fighters usually look better the second time they carry that kind of weight. Criticize the night if you want—but don’t close the book on the career.

Kamaru Usman has a theory—and the more you think about it, the more it explains everything happening around Khamzat Chimaev. Chimaev keeps calling out Alex Pereira, and from a pure fight perspective, it’s fascinating. Pereira is respected, intimidating, and universally liked inside the UFC. That matters. It’s also why this callout hasn’t gotten the push fans expect. But Usman suggests this isn’t about champion-hunting or hype at all. It’s about size. According to Usman, Chimaev may have outgrown the middleweight division entirely. There are rumors—just rumors—that Khamzat walks around extremely heavy, and if that’s true, it explains a lot. It explains why Chimaev vs Dricus du Plessis hasn’t been booked. It explains the delay. And it explains why the Pereira talk won’t go away. The UFC doesn’t like fighters bouncing between divisions. Exceptions are rare. Ilia Topuria and Islam Makhachev earned theirs for very specific reasons. For Chimaev to move to 205, he’d likely have to vacate his place at 185 entirely—and that changes the entire conversation. If Usman is right, this isn’t a stalled division or bad timing. It’s a fighter facing a hard reality and a difficult phone call. And if that call happens, everything about Khamzat Chimaev’s future changes overnight. Watch the full breakdown and decide if this theory finally makes it all make sense. #UFC #KhamzatChimaev #AlexPereira #KamaruUsman #MMA #FightBusiness #UFCRankings #ChaelSonnenBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Shavkat Rakhmonov didn’t lose. He didn’t retire. He didn’t fall down the rankings. He disappeared. And that raises a question the UFC has never answered clearly: how do the rankings actually work? Rakhmonov was undefeated, dominant, and consistently ranked near the top. Then suddenly—he’s gone. The explanation floating around is injury, with his manager Danny Rubenstein confirming knee surgery that could keep him out for most of the year. But that alone doesn’t explain removal. Champions like Ilia Topuria remain ranked while inactive, and Jon Jones has been removed despite actively pursuing a fight. So what’s the real rule? In this breakdown, I question whether the rankings are truly voted on the way fans believe. Is this really an independent panel reaching the same conclusion? Or are fighters quietly removed before ballots are ever submitted? Because it’s hard to believe that enough voters independently decided an undefeated fighter—who’s beaten multiple ranked opponents—suddenly doesn’t belong anywhere. This isn’t about conspiracies. It’s about transparency. If a fighter doesn’t move down, but instead vanishes entirely, someone made that call. And the real mystery isn’t why Shavkat Rakhmonov is gone—it’s who had the authority to take his name off the list. Watch the full breakdown and decide for yourself.

In the fight business, only one thing matters—and that’s winning. Sean O’Malley recently said the UFC has to make Paddy Pimblett vs Dan Hooker, and he’s right. This matchup isn’t about rankings or spreadsheets. It’s about timing, availability, and heat. Paddy is coming off a loss. Dan Hooker is coming off a loss. That doesn’t close the door—it opens it. That’s how real matchmaking works. In this breakdown, I explain why the Hooker fight is not only possible, but obvious. We look at why talk of Arman Tsarukyan, Benoît Saint Denis, and other options sounds good on paper but falls apart in practice. Promoters don’t start at ground zero when a storyline already exists—and Paddy vs Hooker already has history, tension, and audience interest. I also explain why the word “sense” gets fighters and managers into trouble, and how winning the right fight matters more than fighting the “right” guy. If you understand how contenders actually get rebuilt and pushed, this clip tells you everything you need to know. Watch the full breakdown and decide for yourself—because in the end, this one isn’t complicated.

      "description": "Alexander Volkanovski doesn’t just fight — he outworks you, outlasts you, and somehow finds a way. Every single time. Chael Sonnen breaks down what makes Volk different. Winning one gritty fight takes heart. Doing it over and over for years? That takes a lifetime of work. And now, Volkanovski is tying José Aldo’s legendary featherweight record, putting himself in rare air among the greatest 145-pounders ever. For a moment, it felt like this might be the end. His tone was calm. Almost reflective. Like a guy who might be ready to hang them up. And honestly, if Volk had retired, nobody would’ve questioned it. He’s earned that right. But then he did the opposite. Instead of walking away, Volkanovski called out Movsar Evloev and Lerone Murphy — two of the toughest, hungriest contenders in the division. No easy fights. No victory laps. Just straight back into the fire. That tells you everything. Chael explains why that mentality separates champions from legends. Some guys protect their legacy. Volk keeps testing it. He’s not chasing comfort — he’s chasing competition. Retirement doesn’t sound like a man calling out killers. This isn’t the end. It might be another run. #AlexanderVolkanovski #UFC #MMA #JoseAldo #MovsarEvloev #LeroneMurphy #Featherweight #ChaelSonnen",

      "description": "Alexander Volkanovski was closer to becoming a double champion than people remember — and Chael Sonnen thinks he might have actually beaten Islam Makhachev that first night. Not “competitive.” Not “moral victory.” Chael means flat-out won. In this breakdown, Chael revisits their first lightweight title fight and explains why Volk’s performance ages better every single time we watch Islam dominate the division. Makhachev is breaking records, running through contenders, even flirting with welterweight — and we’re supposed to forget that Volkanovski pushed him to the absolute limit? Volk clearly won two rounds. Some argue three. And when the decision came in, nobody felt certain. That’s how close it was. But here’s Chael’s key point: commitment. If Volkanovski had fully relinquished the 145-pound belt and truly moved up to 155 — bigger camp, bigger body, fully adjusted — maybe that tiny gap disappears. Maybe that razor-close fight flips. Maybe we’re talking about “champ-champ” Volk right now. Instead, he tried to do both. And at the highest level, half-measures cost you inches — and inches cost you titles. Looking back, it might be one of the biggest “what ifs” in UFC history. #AlexanderVolkanovski #IslamMakhachev #UFC #MMA #DoubleChamp #Lightweight #Featherweight #chaelsonnen",
