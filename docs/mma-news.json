      "title": "Daniel Cormier PREDICTS Francis Ngannou will KNOCK OUT Jake Paul EASILY after Anthony Joshua KO",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXOqptOlOYQ",
      "description": "Jake Paul wants Francis Ngannou next, and called him soft after getting knocked out by Anthony Joshua in their most recent fight. Daniel Cormier REACTS to Jake's CALLOUT of Francis, and explains why he's going to get knocked out by Francis. DC says that despite lasting more rounds against Joshua than Ngannou did, it was only because of style differences in the boxing ring. Cormier GOES IN ON why Jake Paul will once again get knocked out if he chooses to fight Francis, and breaks down the logic behind Ngannou taking that fight this coming year.

      "description": "This wasn’t just the best fight of the year — it was the greatest fight of 2025, and everything surrounding it made it matter more. Chael Sonnen breaks down the fight he ranks number one on his 2025 list: **Diego Lopes vs. Jean Silva. What made this fight unique wasn’t just the action — it was the stakes. Lopes entered the bout coming off a loss, something that almost never leads to a main-event opportunity. Silva, on the other hand, was riding momentum and fresh off dominant performances, making this his biggest spotlight yet. Chael explains the rarely discussed politics of MMA: winners fight winners, losers don’t headline shows — and why this matchup broke that rule. Add in a sold-out crowd, a head-to-head battle with one of the biggest boxing events of the year, and the pressure to deliver, and the consequences couldn’t have been higher. This wasn’t just about winning a fight — it was about relevance, opportunity, and survival. Both men flipped the switch and went forward with bad intentions. It wasn’t pretty, and it wasn’t cautious — it was aggressive, relentless, and decisive. Lopes’ win demanded a reward, and when you understand what he overcame and who he overcame, that reward makes sense. This breakdown explains why this fight stands alone at number one in 2025.

      "title": "The Second-Best Fight of 2025 Had Everything | Holloway vs Poirier",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNdBsvR3GNo",
      "description": "This fight wasn’t just emotional — it earned its place as the second-best fight of 2025. Chael Sonnen breaks down the unforgettable showdown between Max Holloway and Dustin Poirier in Lafayette, with the BMF Championship on the line. The stakes couldn’t have been higher — this was Poirier’s final fight, in his home state, with the governor in the front row and the entire arena emotionally invested in the outcome. Chael explains why, despite the circumstances, the judges got it right. Holloway and Poirier once again chose violence over convenience — opting to trade punches in bunches instead of leaning on wrestling, clinch work, or safer paths to victory. It was a technical war fought at full speed, with both men exhausting every option and never slowing down. The breakdown also dives into Max Holloway’s commitment to fighting at 155 pounds, why that mattered in this fight, and how Poirier himself described the difference in Holloway’s power and presence. When sentiment is removed and performance is judged honestly, Chael makes the case clear: this fight belongs at number two on the list of the greatest fights of 2025.

      "title": "Why Valentina Shevchenko vs Weili Zhang Made Chael’s Top 5 of 2025",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hqtdr1t0kt4",
      "description": "Coming in at number three on Chael Sonnen’s Top 5 Fights of 2025 is a fight that wasn’t built on hype, chaos, or a dramatic finish — but on pure skill progression. This co-main event between Valentina Shevchenko and Zhang Weili didn’t make the list because of excitement going in, and it didn’t make the list because of fireworks during the fight. It made the list for one reason only: The Bullet got better. Chael breaks down why Valentina’s ability to out-wrestle Weili repeatedly, in every round, was the real story of the fight. After watching Weili handle elite grapplers like Tatiana Suarez, very few expected Valentina to dominate those same exchanges. But she did — easily, consistently, and without hesitation. That’s what elevates this fight. Valentina was already considered one of the best strikers in MMA history, with past wars against Amanda Nunes cementing her legacy. Seeing her suddenly control fights on the mat wasn’t just impressive — it was a revelation. This breakdown isn’t about who’s next or what comes after. It’s about recognizing greatness when it evolves. That’s why this fight earns the #3 spot of 2025. #ChaelSonnen #TopFights2025 #ValentinaShevchenko #ZhangWeili #MMABreakdown #UFCHistory Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "This wasn’t just a great fight — it was the second-best fight of 2025, and most people watching didn’t realize what they were seeing. Chael Sonnen breaks down the unforgettable war between Jiří Procházka and Khalil Rountree Jr. inside T-Mobile Arena, a fight defined by damage, commitment, and one brutal turning point. For two full rounds, Rountree executed a dangerous and disciplined plan — standing his ground, trading shots, chopping the legs, and pressing for a knockout finish. But fighting Procházka comes with a hidden tax: endurance. Chael explains why committing everything to a finish inside a limited time window can become a liability when the opponent refuses to fall. As Rountree began to fade, Procházka stayed upright — and once that happened, the fight was no longer about who was winning rounds. It became about who could still move. This breakdown explains why this fight ranks second-best of the year, not because of a single moment, but because of the psychology, fatigue, and inevitability that unfolded in real time. If you want to understand how elite fights truly turn, this is one you need to study.

      "description": "Click here https://bearmattress.com/chael and use CODE: CHAEL to get 40% off your mattress. If you want to understand what truly defines a great fight, you have to look beyond finishes and highlights. In this video, Chael Sonnen begins counting down his Top 5 Fights of 2025, starting with the fight that landed at number five — a bout shaped as much by chaos and circumstance as by what happened inside the cage. Before the list begins, Chael also shares why sleep, recovery, and preparation matter at the highest level, and why he trusts Bear Mattress to keep him performing at his best. From wild fight-week conditions to last-minute changes that altered an entire card, this breakdown gives rare insight into what fighters and teams were dealing with behind the scenes. The focus then turns to Umar Nurmagomedov vs. Merab Dvalishvili, a fight that wasn’t supposed to be competitive — until it was. Chael explains how pressure, conditioning, and momentum slowly shifted, why fatigue decided the championship rounds, and how Merab’s ability to have fun under fire signaled the arrival of a new star. This is not just a recap. It’s a lesson in preparation, resilience, and why the best fights are about more than who wins. Watch the full breakdown and stay tuned as Chael counts down the rest of the Top 5. #ChaelSonnen #TopFights2025 #UFCAnalysis #MMABreakdown #BearMattressBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Click here https://bearmattress.com/chael and use CODE: CHAEL to get 40% off your mattress. Valentina Shevchenko has been named Female Fighter of the Year, and for once, Chael Sonnen says it out loud: it feels good to say it. But here’s the issue. Despite her dominance, consistency, and legacy, Valentina Shevchenko continues to be placed in co-main events — a spot Chael believes no longer makes sense for the most accomplished female fighter in MMA history. In this breakdown, Chael explains why greatness in combat sports isn’t judged only by skill, but also by visibility, stakes, and where you’re placed on the card. Drawing on a conversation with Dominick Cruz, Chael lays out an uncomfortable truth: pound-for-pound recognition requires the mandate of the audience, not just technical excellence. Chael breaks down Valentina’s recent run — from her battles with Weili Zhang to the rivalry with Alexa Grasso — and explains why she doesn’t look like an aging champion, but a fighter evolving, adapting, and still climbing the mountain. So why isn’t she headlining? Is it the division? The promotion? Or is it time for Valentina and her team to demand main event status — no more explanations, no more excuses? This is a conversation about legacy, opportunity, and why #FighterOfTheYear should never be hidden in the co-main slot. If you care about #UFC, #WMMA, and what greatness is supposed to look like at the highest level, this one matters.

      "description": "Click here https://bearmattress.com/chael and use CODE: CHAEL to get 40% off your mattress. A group of influencers, a viral clip, and one heavyweight legend in the middle of it all. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen gives his take on the confrontation involving Andrei Arlovski and influencer Jack Doherty, after a chaotic video surfaced showing Arlovski facing multiple people at once. Chael walks through what the footage actually shows — and more importantly, what it doesn’t. This wasn’t a trained fighter losing control. This wasn’t a bully running wild. What Chael sees is a veteran professional doing exactly what a real expert does: de-escalating, controlling space, and handling a bad situation without anyone getting seriously hurt. As Chael explains, being skilled in combat puts fighters in a dangerous position outside the cage. When someone tries to provoke a trained professional into using those skills in the wrong environment, the responsibility shifts. A true master proves his point without injuring anyone — and that’s exactly why Chael views this as a win for Arlovski. Chael also addresses the growing trend of influencers entering the “tough guy business,” why it keeps happening, and why fighters didn’t ask for this crossover — but now have to navigate it anyway. In Chael’s final analysis: no foul done. Judgment reserved. Situation handled. If you’re interested in real fight IQ, responsibility, and how professionals carry themselves outside competition, this is a must-watch for fans of #UFC, #MMA, #AndreiArlovski, and honest fight commentary from #ChaelSonnen.

Joshua Van also made four walks — including a world title fight — and got it right every single time. One man ends the year as champion. The other does not. So where is the distinction coming from? Is Fighter of the Year about activity, title fights, or finishing the year with gold? Chael breaks down why Joshua Van’s 2024 resume deserves serious respect and why dismissing his championship moment misses the point entirely.

In this clip, Chael explains why the belief that Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua was fake says more about the viewer than the fight itself. According to Chael, what we saw wasn’t cooperation or entertainment — it was a fighter trying to survive under real pressure. Anyone who’s ever been in a real altercation knows exactly what that looks like. Chael breaks down Jake Paul’s movement, fear response, clinching, and desperation tactics, and explains why dismissing it as scripted is a way for people to avoid accepting how difficult boxing at this level really is. Agree or disagree — this breakdown forces you to look at the fight differently.",
