But he doesn’t just skim the surface — he calls out the myths, the medical “experts,” and the endless pretend conversations that ignore the only data that actually matters. From NCAA rule changes to the psychology of cutting, Chael explains why fighters and wrestlers are the healthiest athletes in the world… and why most fans and officials still get this issue completely wrong. Then Chael pivots to another long-running debate in the sport: eye pokes. Are they accidental? Are they avoidable? Or have we all just agreed to pretend something else is happening? Chael lays out the truth as only he can, comparing MMA to wrestling, judo, and bare knuckle while arguing that accountability — not gloves, rules committees, or redesigns — is the only real fix. If you care about fighter safety, rule enforcement, or the evolution of the sport, this is classic Chael: sharp, honest, and impossible to ignore. #ChaelSonnen #UFCRules #WeightCutting #EyePokes #MMA #MixedMartialArts #UCFFighters #CombatSports Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Sign-up using https://dkng.co/sonnen or through my promo code SONNEN Damon Martin just dropped a take so wild that Chael Sonnen had to stop, rewind, and ask the world one simple question: What are we even talking about here? In this clip, Chael breaks down why calling potential “massive superfights” for Merab Dvalishvili at featherweight isn’t just wrong — it’s fundamentally illogical. Chael walks through the entire argument step-by-step, comparing divisions, drawing parallels to real-world logic, and highlighting why a champion at 135 should, in theory, have the biggest opportunities in his own weight class. Yet Damon’s headline suggests the opposite: that somehow a non-drawing champion at 145 — a fighter not headlining or even co-headlining — is supposed to create a bigger fight for Merab than anyone in his own division. Chael isn’t buying it, and he’s asking Damon to “show his work.” This segment dives into business realities, star power, PPV placement, and the simple math of what actually makes a fight big. If you want a masterclass in MMA logic, this is Chael at his sharpest — funny, irritated, and surgical.

Is Merab really a -425 favorite? Is Yan really a +330 underdog after stuffing 44 takedowns in their first fight? Chael breaks down the perception around the matchup, why fans think it was “rushed,” and the truth behind their first five-round war that most people forgot was even a rematch. He also explains the single adjustment Yan needs to finally flip the script — and why DraftKings may have just taken the pressure off of him entirely.

Sign-up using https://dkng.co/sonnen or through my promo code SONNEN UFC 323 is loaded, but Chael breaks down why a world title fight is sitting in the co-main event and why almost nobody is talking about it. In this clip, Chael tells an incredible behind-the-scenes story from The Ultimate Fighter Brazil with Wanderlei Silva and how Paul Heyman once gave him the most important promotional lesson of his career: “When you can’t work with someone… shoot on the son of a bitch.” That moment sets the stage for what Chael sees happening right now with Alexandre Pantoja and Josh Van. The fight is elite. The athletes are elite. But the promotion isn’t. And Chael explains exactly why that matters. He dives into the DraftKings odds, the matchup itself, and the challenge of selling a co-main event when the fighters refuse to take creative control of their careers. Chael compares this moment to examples like Dricus Du Plessis, Demetrious Johnson, and others who understood how to make themselves impossible to ignore. If you're a fighter, a fan, or someone who wants to understand the business behind the UFC, this clip is a masterclass in why promotion is everything — and why being a world champion isn’t enough if you can’t get people to tune in. 👍 Like, comment, and subscribe for more Chael-style breakdowns.

Sign-up using https://dkng.co/sonnen or through my promo code SONNEN Henry Cejudo said something simple about the eye poke situation: “Man up. Make a call.” And Chael Sonnen agrees. In this video, Chael breaks down exactly why the UFC is stuck in no-man’s-land when it comes to fouls, rulings, and the consequences that follow. Chael explains why eye pokes, headbutts, restarts, and no-contests aren’t just “accidents” — they shape careers, affect fighter contracts, change opportunities, and stall divisions. From Tom Aspinall losing momentum to the heavyweight division grinding to a halt, Chael reveals why the lack of consistency is killing anticipation, the very thing the fight business runs on. This isn’t about who hit harder or who landed more. It’s about conflict, resolution, and closure. And when the UFC doesn’t make a call, everyone pays for it. Chael dives into historical examples, from Holyfield vs Tyson to Aljo vs Yan, and explains why only one thing fixes the sport: real rules, real consequences, and refs with the guts to enforce them. 🔥 If you care about UFC judging, fouls, fairness, and fighter safety — this is a must-watch breakdown. #UFC #ChaelSonnen #MMA #EyePoke #TomAspinall #HenryCejudo #UFCRules Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Chael Sonnen reacts to Kayla’s breakdown, the age gap, and what it really means in the context of both women's careers. Chael also compares Olympic resumes, MMA accomplishments, and the “hierarchy” between Kayla Harrison, Amanda Nunes, and Ronda Rousey — and why fans pretending these fights are equal is pure fantasy. Later in the video, Chael discusses Georges St-Pierre praising Islam Makhachev and contrasts how GSP handles greatness versus how the Ronda/Kayla dynamic has played out.

      "description": "Rumors are swirling about a potential Ronda Rousey vs Katie Taylor boxing match — but Chael Sonnen is here to set the record straight. According to Sonnen, the story is completely untrue, and even the sources reporting it got it wrong. This clip dives deep into why Rousey wouldn’t be matched with Taylor, the role Netflix could play, and why boxing promotions like TKO are the ones who truly understand the numbers behind Rousey’s drawing power. Sonnen also compares the situation to historical boxing megafights like Mayweather vs McGregor to illustrate how these stories often get blown out of proportion. If you’ve been following combat sports or Rousey’s potential comeback, this is a must-watch. Sonnen breaks down the rumor with logic, experience, and insider knowledge — showing why the hype doesn’t match reality. Get the truth, see why this fight won’t happen, and stay ahead of the media noise in boxing and MMA. #RondaRousey #KatieTaylor #Boxing #FightRumors #ChaelSonnen Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Sign-up using https://dkng.co/sonnen or through my promo code SONNEN Amanda Nunes and Kayla Harrison finally faced off after Harrison defeated Julianna Peña, and Chael Sonnen is here to break down the timeline, the motives, and the behind-the-scenes reality that most fans are missing. In this analysis, Chael walks through that moment in Salt Lake City when Amanda stepped into the cage — and why the location actually matters. He breaks down the sincerity of Amanda’s callout, the shifting momentum inside American Top Team, and how Kayla’s rise contributed to Amanda eventually leaving the gym entirely. Chael explains the unwritten rule of MMA camps: champions don’t walk away from the throne unless they can feel the room changing. Whether Amanda was losing rounds or simply sensing the trend, Chael argues that the direction of the team was moving toward Kayla — and that emotional dynamic plays directly into their upcoming fight. He also breaks down the biggest concern: Amanda coaching herself. Chael lays out why every all-time great — from Serena to Mayweather to Jordan — had a coach, and why self-coaching is historically a one-way path to disaster, especially in a five-round fight with a conditioned athlete like Kayla Harrison. Finally, Chael addresses the debate around their placement as a co-main event. He explains why this fight was created in a co-main event moment and why expecting it to headline is misunderstanding how the sport works. If you want real insight, not hype, this is vintage Chael Sonnen. #UFC #MMA #AmandaNunes #KaylaHarrison #ChaelSonnen #UFCHistory #AmericanTopTeamBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
