      "description": "Everybody says the same thing about Jon Jones: “He failed a PED test — he can’t be the GOAT.” Okay… but that’s not the question. We’re not debating the cleanest fighter of all time. We’re debating the greatest fighter of all time — and those are two very different conversations. In this video, I break down why Jon Jones’ legacy can’t just be erased because he got caught. Look at the résumé: youngest champ ever, undefeated for over a decade, dominated legends, solved every style, moved to heavyweight and took the belt. Skill for skill, fight IQ, creativity, composure under pressure — nobody has ever looked more complete inside the Octagon. Here’s the uncomfortable truth about MMA: every era has gray areas. Rules change. Substances change. Testing changes. If you’re going to disqualify Jon completely, you’d have to rewrite the sport’s entire history. So what really defines greatness? Dominance? Championships? Longevity? Or perfection outside the cage? Love him or hate him, Jon Jones might still be the most talented fighter we’ve ever seen. And that’s the debate nobody wants to have honestly.

      "description": "The lightweight division just exploded… and Ilia Topuria might already be on a collision course with Islam Makhachev. But it’s not that simple. Chael breaks down why the UFC likely won’t book Islam vs Topuria next, why Justin Gaethje is suddenly the most dangerous man in the mix, and how Conor McGregor, Paddy Pimblett, and even Jon Jones are somehow tied into the biggest matchmaking shuffle of the year. If you thought Ilia was getting an immediate super fight — think again. Gaethje isn’t just a placeholder. He’s a problem. Relentless pressure. Endless gas tank. Pure violence. Nobody walks through Justin clean. Meanwhile, Conor’s return, catchweight talks, and the White House card rumors are creating chaos across three divisions. Titles. Contenders. Superfights. Everything is moving at once. Topuria vs Gaethje? Islam waiting? Conor sneaking back in? This changes everything at 155.

      "description": "Ilia Topuria isn’t just fighting opponents anymore. Now he’s fighting pressure. There’s a difference between competing because you want to… and competing because you have to. Up until now, Topuria fought like a free man — confident, loose, dangerous. But when the money changes, when the responsibilities stack up, when the paydays get split and the business gets heavier? That’s when a fighter finds out who he really is. Chael Sonnen breaks down the reality nobody talks about: finances change psychology. Does that make Ilia hungrier? Or does it tighten him up? Because once you’re fighting to earn instead of fighting for love, everything shifts. And while fans dream about Ilia Topuria vs Islam Makhachev super fights, the UFC doesn’t work that way. You don’t jump divisions and skip the line without defending your belt first. There’s a process. Which is why the most logical — and most violent — answer is sitting right in front of us: Justin Gaethje. No warm-up. No easy night. No favors. Just a dogfight with the most dangerous lightweight in the sport. If Topuria wants to prove he’s built different, this is the test. Because Gaethje doesn’t let you coast. You either break… or you become undeniable. #IliaTopuria #JustinGaethje #IslamMakhachev #UFC #MMA #Lightweight #FightNews #ChaelSonnen",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0LDBOAR69nA",
      "description": "Michael Chandler just did what Michael Chandler always does — he showed up ready to fight… anybody. While the MMA world speculates about Conor McGregor, the BMF title, and a potential White House mega-event, Chandler kept it simple: June 14th, he’s in. No drama. No waiting. No “maybe.” He calls himself the most reliable, most electrifying guy on the roster — and honestly, history backs that up. Chael Sonnen breaks down why that mindset matters. Chandler isn’t sitting around hoping for the Conor fight. Sure, he wants it — everybody does — but if it doesn’t materialize, he’s already lining up options. After Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett, Chandler gave respect to both: Gaethje for proving he’s elite, Paddy for being tougher than people thought. And then? He casually says he’d love another crack at Paddy too. That’s vintage Chandler. Stay active. Stay dangerous. Stay visible. While other guys negotiate, Chandler competes. Whether it’s McGregor, Pimblett, or anyone else, he’s planting a flag right now: put me on the card. Because when a big stage shows up — especially one as wild as the White House lawn — you want the guy who always says yes. #MichaelChandler #ConorMcGregor #JustinGaethje #PaddyPimblett #UFC #BMF #MMA #ChaelSonnen",

      "description": "Jon Jones is one of the greatest talents the sport has ever seen — but right now, his situation doesn’t create urgency, excitement, or direction. It creates something else. Eh. This discussion breaks down why Jon Jones’ current status — retirement talk, medical issues, an eight-day exit and return, and the absence from the rankings — hasn’t actually changed the landscape of the UFC heavyweight division. Nothing was canceled.No title was delayed.No must-see fight disappeared. That’s the problem. Using a Super Bowl commercial as the analogy, this episode explores why fans, media, and even the business side of the sport are stuck in neutral when it comes to Jon Jones — despite his greatness. Key questions addressed: * Why the eight-day retirement mattered more than it seemed * Why there is no clear heavyweight fight people are demanding * Why a “comeback” only works if you actually leave * How Jon Jones could have been in a very different position today * Why fantasy matchmaking doesn’t solve real problems This isn’t criticism.It’s context. And until something changes, the answer to “do you care?” remains the same: Eh.

      "description": "The matchmaker meeting for the White House UFC card is happening — and the picture is starting to take shape. While there’s still uncertainty around the total number of fights and the final structure of the card, certain names are beginning to stand out as likely participants. This breakdown looks at: * What’s been publicly suggested about the size of the card * Which fighters appear most likely to be booked * Why certain stars make sense — and others don’t * How the UFC historically approaches special-event cards * Why some rumored matchups face practical resistance One name stands above the rest in terms of certainty, while others depend on timing, availability, and momentum. Rather than fantasy matchmaking, this is about path of least resistance — how these cards are actually built behind the scenes. There are still unknowns, including potential returns, injury timelines, and whether certain long-discussed matchups are realistic right now. But if you’re looking for the most probable direction — not the loudest rumor — this is where the board currently points.

      "description": "A recent clip from Joaquin Buckley might be the most entertaining — and accurate — breakdown of the division we’ve seen in a while. Buckley didn’t just talk trash.He made a point. Right now, one of the UFC’s hottest divisions is full of talent — but short on actual fights. Champions and contenders are active publicly, but not booked competitively. And Buckley noticed. From a performance standpoint, this might be his best work yet. It was funny.It was simple.And it landed. Beyond the entertainment value, the clip raises a legitimate question:Why do we currently have so many top names without fights — and so few title bouts officially booked? That context matters, especially with rumors swirling about future mega-events and stacked cards. Whether or not those rumors are true, Buckley’s approach cuts through the noise. He named names.He welcomed anyone.And he positioned himself as the guy you call when nobody else wants the fight. That’s how you build momentum. From an execution standpoint — this was clean, intentional, and effective. Grade: A+. CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — Buckley’s Rant Goes ViralWhy this clip immediately grabbed attention. 0:33 — Performance FirstWhy this may be Buckley’s best work as an entertainer. 0:54 — The Point Beneath the NoiseWhy the callout actually raises a fair question. 1:16 — No Title Fights on the BoardWhy the lack of officially booked title fights matters. 1:39 — Rumors vs RealityThe White House card talk and why it’s likely exaggerated. 2:17 — Buckley’s Simple MessageThe “biggest hammers” and why Buckley welcomes all of them. 2:36 — The Value of WillingnessWhy being ready to fight matters behind the scenes. 3:00 — Picking a Fight on PurposeWhy this was strategic, not emotional. 3:16 — Final GradeWhy this performance earns an A+.

      "description": "If anything negative has ever been said about Andrei Arlovski, it deserves to be reconsidered. Arlovski was the heavyweight champion of the world and the face of the UFC at its peak. When others would have walked away, he kept competing. When the spotlight disappeared, he kept fighting. When the money dried up, the venues got smaller, and the cameras turned off — he still showed up. This isn’t a story about hype or branding. It’s a story about competition. From headlining UFC pay-per-views, to taking fights no one else would accept, to rebuilding his career after setbacks inside and outside the cage, Arlovski proved something rare: he wasn’t chasing fame — he was chasing fights. That truth was tested repeatedly: Losing the belt and losing momentum The collapse of Affliction after the loss to Fedor Emelianenko Fighting in small venues with no cameras Accepting impossible matchups simply because they were offered Returning to the UFC and staying there longer than almost anyone Battling and surviving stage-four cancer Becoming a bare-knuckle champion at 47 by defeating Ben Rothwell Andrei Arlovski didn’t endure because he was an athlete. He endured because he was a competitor. If there was ever doubt — it’s time to clear it up. ⏱️ CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — Clearing the Record Why past criticism of Andrei Arlovski deserves to be revisited. 0:41 — Arlovski at the Top of the UFC Heavyweight champion, main-event star, and the face of the company. 1:29 — Athlete vs Fighter Why being a great athlete isn’t an insult — and how toughness shows up later. 2:18 — Losing the Belt, Losing the Spotlight How momentum and marketing moved on after the title loss. 3:06 — The Affliction Era and Fedor Why the loss to Fedor looked like the end — and wasn’t. 3:58 — When the Cameras Turned Off Fighting in small venues, no TV, no hype — and still showing up. 4:45 — Accepting the Impossible Fight Why taking on Roy “Rumble” Johnson said everything about Arlovski’s mindset. 5:36 — The Long Road Back to the UFC How Arlovski rebuilt his career quietly and stayed relevant. 6:18 — Life Outside the Cage Cancer, survival, and fighting again after remission. 7:08 — Bare Knuckle at 47 Why beating Ben Rothwell without gloves completed the story. 8:02 — Final Reassessment Why Andrei Arlovski should be remembered as a true competitor.

      "title": "Biting an Ear in MMA: Rage, Quitting, or Something Else?",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRSzM8ynq_s",
      "description": "A recent MMA fight ended in chaos when a fighter intentionally bit his opponent’s ear — drawing immediate comparisons to Tyson–Holyfield and raising serious questions about intent, control, and professionalism. Credit to Ariel Helwani for first highlighting the incident and framing it as one of the most extreme moments the sport has seen in years. But this situation feels different. When Mike Tyson bit Evander Holyfield, the reason was clear: frustration, desperation, and an attempt to hurt an opponent who was winning within the rules. Other historical examples — including alleged incidents involving Matt Lindland — point to something else entirely: competitiveness so intense that it spills outside the rules in a bid to win. This incident doesn’t fit either category cleanly. It happened quickly. There was no prolonged dominance, no clear desperation, and no obvious moment that forced a choice between losing and cheating. That raises uncomfortable questions: Was this an attempt to injure? Was it a way out? Or was it a complete loss of emotional control? MMA has very few rules — which makes it essential that the ones that exist are respected. This isn’t about being prudish. It’s about professionalism, safety, and the responsibility fighters have when they step into a cage. The discussion also explores what should happen next: Rematch or permanent separation? Suspension or license revocation? Or a path back through accountability and discipline? There’s a reason every professional learns this lesson eventually: When the fight ends, the fight ends. ⏱️ CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — The Incident A shocking ear bite and immediate Tyson–Holyfield comparisons. 0:34 — Rage or Strategy? Is biting an attempt to hurt someone — or to escape a fight? 1:05 — Why Tyson’s Case Was Different Clear frustration, clear motive, clear loss inside the rules. 1:44 — The Lindland Example How extreme competitiveness can cross the line without quitting. 2:41 — Why This One Feels Different The speed, timing, and lack of desperation change the interpretation. 3:33 — Few Rules, Big Responsibility Why MMA’s limited rule set makes enforcement essential. 4:28 — Intent vs Outcome Why accidental fouls and intentional acts aren’t the same conversation. 5:22 — What Should the Consequence Be? Rematch, suspension, license removal, or something else? 6:15 — Losing Control After the Fight The psychological moment when adrenaline hasn’t shut off yet. 7:10 — Early MMA Lessons Why even legends had to learn professionalism the hard way. 8:04 — Final Rule The simplest rule of all: don’t bite someone’s ear.

      "description": "Jon Jones made major headlines after getting filmed saying he has severe arthritis he's dealing with. Daniel Cormier IS BACK to give his reaction to the viral video revealing Jon's injuries, and why \"it's a sad day\" to see Jones is finally doing fighting in the sport. DC GOES IN ON why he thinks there's NO WAY Jones will wrestle him after this news came out, and that we should get ready to now see the end of Jones' career in the UFC. See why Cormier thinks Jon is actually okay with the news coming out, despite his public comments claiming he didn't know he was being filmed. And with Justin Gaethje vs. Ilia Topuria almost certainly headlining the White House, DC gives his take on the future UFC title fight.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKz3Jd4b-X4",
      "description": "George St-Pierre believes Ilia Topuria could one day finish his career as the UFC’s undisputed greatest of all time. That’s enormous praise — especially coming from the man many consider the current GOAT. But what would that actually require? This discussion breaks down what “greatest of all time” really means in MMA, and why résumé counting alone doesn’t answer the question. From Topuria’s dominance at featherweight to the challenges awaiting him at lightweight, the conversation quickly becomes about how wins matter — not just how many. It also raises unavoidable comparisons: Is Topuria already the greatest featherweight ever? What separates greatness at 145 from greatness at 155? How do legends like Khabib Nurmagomedov, Islam Makhachev, and Alexander Volkanovski factor into the discussion? Can someone truly be the GOAT without facing their era’s defining rival? Longevity, dominance, adversity, and timing all matter — but there may be one path that settles the debate immediately. This isn’t about resumes. It’s about understanding what you’re watching. ⏱️ CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — GSP’s Prediction Why George St-Pierre’s praise of Ilia Topuria matters more than anyone else’s. 0:27 — What Does “GOAT” Actually Mean? Why greatness isn’t just a checklist of title defenses. 0:53 — Has Ilia Already Cleaned Out 145? The Volkanovski win and why the lack of a rematch matters. 1:36 — Is Ilia the Greatest Featherweight Ever? Why fans give that title to Volk — and what that implies for Ilia. 2:41 — Moving to 155: A Different Standard Why lightweight greatness is measured differently. 3:08 — Khabib, BJ Penn, and Dominance What Ilia would need to match or surpass at lightweight. 3:53 — The Islam Question Can Ilia be the GOAT if he and Islam never fight? 4:33 — Two Champions, Same Era Why Ilia and Islam’s parallel accomplishments complicate the argument. 5:06 — Losses, Timing, and Narrative How undefeated records and context influence legacy. 5:40 — Ilia Tried to Make the Fight Why intent and willingness matter in GOAT discussions. 6:33 — Why Résumés Aren’t Enough The difference between “best career” and “best fighter.” 7:26 — Longevity vs One Defining Win Five more fights — or one fight that ends the debate. 8:32 — Final Thought Why beating Islam right now may be the fastest path to GOAT status.

      "description": "This is not an accusation and it is not based on inside information. It’s a look at why the current situation surrounding Jon Jones doesn’t seem to add up. Jon Jones — the reigning heavyweight champion, undefeated at heavyweight, and widely regarded as one of the greatest fighters of all time — is currently absent from the rankings. At the same time, Jones has publicly discussed significant health issues, including hip problems and uncertainty about returning to competition. Historically, the MMA community has been given one clear reason why a signed fighter would be ineligible to be ranked. No second explanation has ever been formally presented. That gap raises questions — not conclusions. This discussion examines: How rankings eligibility has been explained in the past Why Jones’ résumé makes his absence difficult to reconcile Patterns the sport has seen before (without applying them here) The conflicting public signals surrounding Jones’ health and activity There is no claim being made that Jon Jones failed a drug test. In fact, if such information existed, this conversation would not be happening. The goal here is simple: Look at the facts as presented and ask whether they logically align. You decide what to make of it. Something Doesn’t Make Sense With the Jon Jones CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — Clear Disclaimer Why this is not an accusation and not based on inside information. 0:09 — The Rankings Don’t Add Up Why Jon Jones’ résumé makes his absence from the rankings hard to explain. 0:24 — Jones’ Health Statements Hip replacement, arthritis, and uncertainty about returning. 0:36 — The Only Known Reason Fighters Aren’t Ranked Why failing a drug test is the only established reason a signed fighter is excluded. 0:54 — No Second Explanation Has Ever Been Given Why the MMA community has never been offered an alternative rationale. 1:07 — A Pattern Seen Before How medical hardship stories have historically preceded failed test announcements (without applying that claim here). 1:23 — How Fighters Try to Bridge the Gap Why some athletes retroactively connect health issues to later test results. 2:10 — Medical Hardship vs Public Activity Why severe health claims raise questions when paired with visible athletic activity. 2:39 — No Inside Information Why this discussion would not exist if there were actual knowledge of a failed test. 3:00 — Conflicting Signals Hip replacement concerns, retirement uncertainty, and playing televised flag football. 3:24 — Is the Ranking Linked to the Situation? Why the timing creates confusion, not conclusions. 3:42 — The Only Exception Ever Cited Why behind-the-scenes dealings with the testing agency are the sole known exclusion. 3:55 — Final Question to the Audience Why viewers are asked to assess the facts for themselves.

      "title": "Does Failing a PED Test Disqualify Jon Jones From GOAT Status?",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhN09KxVCqQ",
      "description": "Coach Javier Mendez recently stated that Jon Jones should not be included in the GOAT discussion because of a failed PED test. That argument sounds reasonable — but it doesn’t settle the issue. The real question isn’t whether Jon Jones was the cleanest athlete of all time. It’s whether he was the greatest fighter of all time — and those are not the same conversation. Standards change. Rules evolve. Substances banned today may be permitted tomorrow, just as many things once allowed are now prohibited. Evaluating greatness across eras quickly becomes complicated. If given a choice — one fighter’s complete skill set, passed down to the next generation — most would choose Jon Jones. Not because of paperwork or testing history, but because of skill, adaptability, and dominance inside the cage. This discussion also raises broader questions: How do failed tests factor into legacy? Who decides when an asterisk applies? How should fighters from different eras be compared? Where do legends like Fedor Emelianenko and Khabib Nurmagomedov fit into the conversation? The conclusion is clear: Jon Jones may not be the cleanest fighter of all time — but failing a PED test does not disqualify him from being the greatest fighter of all time. CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — Javier Mendes’ Claim Why failing a PED test is being used to exclude Jon Jones from the GOAT discussion. 0:39 — Clean vs Greatest Why “cleanest fighter” and “greatest fighter” are two completely different conversations. 1:05 — Rules Change Over Time How banned substances, testing standards, and enforcement shift across eras. 1:38 — The Skill Test Thought Experiment If you could pass one fighter’s skills to the next generation, who would you choose? 2:27 — Does a Failed Test Require an Asterisk? Who decides legacy disqualification — fans, commissions, or history? 3:00 — Where Does Fedor Fit? Why fighters without UFC runs are often discounted — fairly or unfairly. 3:34 — Comparing Eras Is Inherently Flawed Why dominance in one era doesn’t translate cleanly to another. 4:13 — Fighters Who Used PEDs but Never Failed Why the discussion becomes a slippery slope when enforcement is inconsistent. 4:56 — Cleanest Fighter vs Greatest Fighter Why Jon Jones clearly fails one category but remains eligible for the other. 5:18 — GOAT vs “Greatest of His Time” Why this framing may be the most honest way to evaluate legacy. 5:59 — Final Verdict Why failing a PED test does not disqualify Jon Jones from GOAT consideration.

After travelling across four continents in four weeks — England, Georgia, Las Vegas for UFC 324, and Sydney — ‘The Count’ gives his take on everything from Alexander Volkanovski’s dominant title defence over Diego Lopes, to the chaos of a shocking ear-bite incident in a Russian MMA promotion. Bisping also looks ahead to what’s next for the lightweight division, the future of interim titles, Tom Aspinall’s injury setback, and whether Jon Jones will ever step back into the Octagon again.

      "description": "Did Jon Jones just quietly walk away from the biggest fight of his career? Chael Sonnen reacts to a surprising interview where Jones revealed something we don’t normally hear from champions — severe arthritis in his hip. Not soreness. Not wear and tear. Severe arthritis. And for the first time in a long time, Jon wasn’t talking about fights, belts, or comebacks. He was talking about life after fighting. No mention of a White House supercard. No mention of competing. No big callouts. Instead, Jones talked about protecting what he has left physically and spending time playing with his son. That’s not the language of a guy gearing up for Alex Pereira or any mega-event. Then Pereira adds fuel to the fire, saying flat-out he won’t be fighting Jon Jones at the White House. Put it together, and Chael connects the dots: this might not be negotiation tactics. This might be reality. Jones may have just removed himself from contention entirely. If the dream superfight was ever going to happen… this could be the moment it died. Sometimes it’s not what a fighter says — it’s what they don’t say. #JonJones #AlexPereira #UFC #MMA #Heavyweight #ChaelSonnen #CombatSports #Superfight",

      "description": "The champ is back — and no, Chael Sonnen isn’t talking about himself. He’s talking about Ilia Topuria. Topuria returning means one thing: massive fights. And on paper, the biggest fight you can possibly make in the sport right now is simple — Ilia Topuria vs. Islam Makhachev. Champion vs. champion. Star vs. star. It sells itself. But Chael says pump the brakes. The UFC likely isn’t booking that unless Ilia gives up his belt or fully commits to lightweight. That’s a big sacrifice — and historically, the company doesn’t force those moves lightly. Which means the fight we think we’re getting… probably isn’t next. So what is? Enter Justin Gaethje. Chael argues we’ve disrespected Gaethje long enough. This isn’t just some action fighter — this is a true competitor. A guy who doesn’t wilt under pressure, doesn’t fold backstage, and definitely doesn’t fold in the cage. Skill for skill, toughness for toughness, Gaethje is a nightmare matchup for anyone — including Topuria. Ilia might be elite. But Justin is something different: proven chaos. If Islam isn’t next, Topuria vs. Gaethje might be the real superfight hiding in plain sight. #IliaTopuria #JustinGaethje #IslamMakhachev #UFC #MMA #Lightweight #ChaelSonnen #CombatSports",

      "description": "Jorge Masvidal just said something that stopped Chael Sonnen in his tracks — he called Ilia Topuria the Michael Jordan of MMA. Think about that. Masvidal didn’t just praise Topuria. He laid out a path to all-time greatness: move up, beat Islam Makhachev, grab a second belt, then chase a third at welterweight. If Ilia holds titles at 145, 155, and 170, Masvidal says you can’t deny him anymore. Not Jon Jones. Not Georges St-Pierre. Not Khabib. Nobody. Chael breaks down how crazy — and how realistic — this actually sounds. Because here’s the twist: Topuria might already be closer than people think. He’s the featherweight champ, he’s proven he can compete at lightweight, and he already owns the BMF title. The only reason he’s not technically a simultaneous multi-division champ? Paperwork and timing. Competition-wise, the skills are there. Power. Boxing. Confidence. Zero fear of moving up. Chael asks the real question: if Topuria beats Islam, does the GOAT debate instantly change? It sounds bold now… until it happens. Then it’ll sound obvious. #IliaTopuria #JorgeMasvidal #IslamMakhachev #UFC #MMA #GOAT #JonJones #GSP #Khabib #ChaelSonnen",
