      "description": "On this episode of Good Guy / Bad Guy…DC & Chael are taking over the Big Apple ahead of UFC 322! Islam Makhachev has vacated his Lightweight title in hopes of getting the belt currently held by Welterweight Champ Jack Della Maddalena. But is the risk worth the reward? Does he surpass Khabib Nurmagomedov with a win? ESPN tested Islam’s recorded grip strength and it was higher than Light Heavyweight Champ Alex Pereira’s. So, were putting the guys to the test! Can you guess who has the stronger grip? Plus, a Super Fight is upon us when the #1 Women’s Pound-4-Pound takes on the #2. Is Valentina Shevchenko vs Zhang Weili the greatest Women’s fight of all time? Then, this week in MMA history the original Double Champ, Conor McGregor made history at Madison Square Garden becoming the 1st fighter to hold titles in two divisions simultaneously. But have we seen the last of the Champ-Champ era? And, you do NOT want to miss which UFC 322 fighters the guys believe need to spend 2-3 years in Dagestan. ✔ For more UFC, sign up for ESPN+ http://espnplus.com/ufc/youtube ✔ Get the ESPN App: http://www.espn.com/espn/apps/espn ✔ Subscribe to ESPN on YouTube: http://es.pn/SUBSCRIBEtoYOUTUBE ✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC ✔ Subscribe to NBA on ESPN on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoNBAonESPN ✔ Watch ESPN on YouTube TV: http://es.pn/YouTubeTV",

Sign-up using https://dkng.co/sonnen or through my promo code SONNEN Alex Pereira just shook the combat sports world. In a move only Chael Sonnen could break down, Pereira publicly called out Khamzat Chimaev for a grappling match—leaving fans buzzing about what might happen next. But there’s more to this story than just a challenge; it’s about strategy, legacy, and willingness to fight. Chael explains the nuance behind this bold call-out. Pereira, already one of the top fighters of his era, has consistently shown willingness to step up, even when the stakes are high. Khamzat Chimaev, meanwhile, has his own ambitions and is focused on bigger matchups, leaving Pereira’s challenge in an interesting trap: will Chimaev accept, ignore, or refuse? Chael uses examples from past matchups—like Ilia Taporia vs. Islam Makhachev—to show how willingness alone shapes legacy, regardless of who actually wins inside the cage. This isn’t just hype—Chael emphasizes how these decisions impact rankings, fan perception, and the “greatest of all time” conversation. Even if a grappling match never happens, Pereira’s move forces Khamzat to respond, and it keeps Pereira in the spotlight as a fearless competitor unafraid to make bold plays. Watch as Chael Sonnen breaks down Pereira’s strategy, explains the potential outcomes, and teases the next chapter in this high-stakes chess game between two elite fighters. Don’t miss this in-depth analysis of one of the most provocative moments in MMA recently. #AlexPereira #KhamzatChimaev #MMA #ChaelSonnen #GrapplingChallenge #UFC #UFCBJJ Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Sign-up using https://dkng.co/sonnen or through my promo code SONNEN Rogan vs. Ronda — Chael Sonnen breaks down the real story. In this clip, Chael explains why Joe Rogan’s comments about Ronda Rousey weren’t personal, weren’t disrespectful, and absolutely weren’t wrong. Rogan was simply following the one golden rule he once gave Chael: “Say what you see.” Chael dives into how the tension between Rogan and Ronda started, why her feelings were hurt, and why that reaction shows a bigger disconnect — not just about her career, but about the entire history of women’s MMA. Chael lays out why it’s important to tell Ronda’s story accurately: to celebrate what she did without erasing the greatness of Amanda Nunes, Cris Cyborg, Valentina Shevchenko, Kayla Harrison, Julianna Peña, Rose Namajunas, and the women who came after her. He also explains the trap of calling anyone “the greatest of all time” without context. Just like with Michael Jordan talk, Chael argues it unintentionally disrespects every athlete who elevated the sport afterward. Ronda wasn’t wrong for being proud — but the myth around her has to be corrected so the sport keeps moving forward. Chael ends by addressing Ronda’s claim that Rogan “isn’t an expert.” He shuts that down immediately. No one besides Dana White has seen more fights, called more fights, or spent more time studying MMA than Joe Rogan. Experience matters — and Rogan is an expert whether he fought professionally or not. Watch the full breakdown to hear Chael explain the nuances, the history, and why setting the record straight matters. #MMA #ChaelSonnen #RondaRousey #JoeRogan #UFCHistory #WMMA #UFC Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "If Islam Makhachev beats Jack Hermansson and becomes the 170-pound UFC champion, Chael Sonnen says one thing’s for sure — Islam is never going back to lightweight. Once a fighter tastes success at a higher weight class, history shows they don’t go back down. And Chael’s seen it all. In this clip, Chael breaks down why cutting back to 155 would make no sense for Islam. The benefits of staying at welterweight go beyond performance — it’s about quality of life, training happiness, and longevity in the fight game. As Chael puts it, Islam doesn’t even realize yet how much better life feels when you’re not killing yourself to make weight. Chael’s take isn’t just opinion — it’s perspective from a fighter who’s been there. Once you’ve competed comfortably, won big, and built momentum at a heavier class, going back down becomes almost unimaginable. If Islam claims gold at 170, that could mark the official end of his lightweight era. 👉 Watch more of Chael’s fight insights and predictions right here.",

Sign-up using https://dkng.co/sonnen or through my promo code SONNEN Chael Sonnen reacts to the wild turn of events surrounding Francis Ngannou, Jake Paul, and Anthony Joshua — and why Ngannou might’ve just cost himself life-changing money. Chael breaks down how Jake Paul’s rumored fight with Francis Ngannou fell apart, revealing why Francis turned down the opportunity and how it left the door open for a new mega matchup: Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua. According to Chael, Joshua’s professionalism, Olympic pedigree, and legacy in boxing give the fight credibility — while Ngannou’s indecision showed just how quickly fortunes can flip in combat sports. From behind-the-scenes texts to Chael’s blunt assessment of “what makes sense” in the fight game, this episode captures everything that makes Sonnen’s analysis must-watch: honesty, humor, and hard truth. He explains why both Jake Paul supporters and haters have something to gain — and how this matchup could silence every critic once and for all. Watch as Chael breaks down the business, the risk, and the narrative behind Jake Paul’s next big move — and what it means for the heavyweight world. #JakePaul #FrancisNgannou #AnthonyJoshua #ChaelSonnen #Boxing #MMA #FightNews #CombatSports Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Chael Sonnen has made it official — his pick for Islam Makhachev vs. Jack Hermansson is in. And he’s calling it Islam by decision. But like always, there’s more to this breakdown than a simple pick. Chael dives into the layers of this matchup: Jack’s breakout performance against Belal Muhammad, Islam’s relentless top game, and why the classic “striker vs. grappler” label doesn’t quite fit here. Jack’s shown he can fight outside his comfort zone — but can he do it twice? That’s the question. Sonnen explains why Islam’s pressure, control, and ability to drag fights deep into rounds four and five make him the safer bet — while still giving credit to Jack’s surprising evolution. And of course, Chael drops one last signature twist: “I’m putting the curse on this one.” This isn’t just a prediction — it’s Chael breaking down momentum, mindset, and what separates good fighters from great ones. 👉 Subscribe for more official predictions and fight IQ from Chael.",

      "description": "Chael Sonnen says it straight: Khabib’s wrong on this one. When it comes to Islam Makhachev vs. Ilia Topuria, everyone’s asking the wrong question — it’s not if they fight, it’s where. The debate over whether Ilia should drop to 155 misses the whole point. Chael lays it out clearly: if they do this fight at 170 pounds, you open the door to something historic — the chance for Ilia Topuria to become the first-ever three-division champion. That’s the story. That’s the headline. But Team Khabib, according to Chael, is too focused on protecting Islam instead of chasing legacy. This is classic Chael analysis — bold, strategic, and grounded in the real fight business. Forget what’s “best for your guy.” The right move is what gets the fight, what grows the brand, what captures history. Islam vs. Ilia at 170 isn’t just a matchup — it’s an event that changes divisions, rankings, and pay-per-views overnight. 👉 Watch more of Chael’s unfiltered takes and stay ahead of MMA’s power moves.",

From Jose Aldo and Israel Adesanya to Alex Pereira, the script has flipped. The striker-versus-grappler battle isn’t what it used to be, and history’s starting to argue back. Chael dives into the upcoming matchup between Islam Makhachev and Jack Hermansson, dissecting why this fight isn’t as predictable as people think. Jack didn’t chase this fight — he was forced into it. Meanwhile, Islam chose to move up for this exact opponent. That alone tells you something. It tells Chael everything. This isn’t just about styles — it’s about strategy, psychology, and what fighters know behind the scenes. When Chael says, “these guys already know who’s going to win,” you better believe there’s meaning behind it. And when he mentions “the curse,” you know he’s about to stir the pot. Stick around, because this one changes how we look at MMA history — and who really controls the fight game. 👉 Watch more breakdowns from Chael and stay sharp.",

Chael gives Khabib credit — but explains where he’s wrong. The key isn’t just the names; it’s the stakes. If the UFC books Islam vs Ilia at 170, it could create the first-ever chance for Ilia to become a Champ-Champ. That’s the move Team Khabib might be overlooking. Chael also talks about the rumored “White House” card, the politics behind UFC matchmaking, and how the biggest fights aren’t given — they’re earned through campaign and narrative. #UFC #MMA #ChaelSonnen #IslamMakhachev #IliaTopuria #JonJones #AlexPereira #UFCNews #MMAAnalysis #UFC322 #FightBreakdown #MMAFights #UFCPredictions #FightAnalysis #CombatSports Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
