      "description": "Michael Bisping said it best: there’s no way on earth Jake Paul knocks out Anthony Joshua. And Chael agrees — not as a hot take, but as a reality check. In this breakdown, Chael goes after one of the most repeated myths in fight culture: “puncher’s chance.” People throw that phrase around like it applies to every matchup, every weekend… and Chael’s calling it what it is: lazy thinking. Joshua is bigger, longer, hits harder, and he’s an Olympic champion. Jake is stepping into a world where you don’t “play boxing,” and if this is a real fight, it’s real danger — not for Joshua. But here’s the twist: the scariest outcome isn’t Joshua blasting him out fast. The worst outcome is Joshua carrying him — touching him up, stretching it out, and letting damage pile up because the show demands more than 30 seconds. That’s the warning. That’s the truth. And Chael’s saying it out loud. #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #ChaelSonnen #MichaelBisping #Boxing #FightTalk #CombatSport Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

On this edition, he and MMA Junkie Radio host George Garcia discuss the following: (0:00) - Intro (1:09) - Manel Kape should get the first UFC flyweight title shot against Joshua Van. (7:00) - Francis Ngannou vs. Vadim Nemkov is a layup fight booking the PFL needs to make ASAP. (14:33) - Cris Cyborg vs. Dakota Ditcheva is another layup fight booking the PFL needs to make ASAP. (20:38) - People will be talking about Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua post-fight for all the wrong reasons. (27:17) - Joe Rogan is right: It WOULD be a travesty for Jon Jones not to fight at the White House.

      "description": "Ilia Topuria didn’t vacate the belt — but the headlines sure made it feel like he did. Chael Sonnen breaks down what actually happened, why the reporting got people confused, and what it means for the UFC’s next move. If Ilia isn’t competing for a while, does the promotion go full interim… or do they keep pretending this is business as usual? Chael also connects the dots on the ripple effects: Justin Gaethje vs Paddy Pimblett getting matched up without it being “undisputed,” why fans assumed a vacancy in the first place, and how Arman Tsarukyan’s path keeps getting reshuffled even after being labeled the clear next contender. Then there’s the part nobody wants to talk about: the pound-for-pound shuffle. Islam Makhachev jumps Ilia in the rankings — without Ilia losing a fight — and Chael explains why that matters if the UFC ever wants to sell Islam vs Ilia as more than “just another super fight.” Bottom line: if Ilia’s sidelined, the UFC needs a clean solution — not confusion, not half-measures, and not misleading narratives. #UFC #ChaelSonnen #IliaTopuria #IslamMakhachev #P4P #MMANews #Gaethje #PaddyPimblett Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Manel Kape is the number one contender — and Chael Sonnen wants to know why anyone is pretending that’s controversial. In this video, Chael breaks down why Kape’s recent run makes him impossible to ignore, including three straight knockouts and momentum that the flyweight division desperately needs. While some fans are focused on injury debates and immediate rematches, Chael explains why getting hurt during a takedown doesn’t earn you a title shot — and never has. Chael also addresses the confusion surrounding Joshua Van’s championship, the reaction to Alexandre Pantoja’s injury, and why emotions often cloud ranking logic. If that same injury had happened later in the fight, nobody would be calling it a fluke — and that’s the point. The flyweight division is loaded right now, but divisions don’t stay hot by standing still. They move forward by rewarding wins, momentum, and finishes. That’s how stars are built — just like Khamzat Chimaev was built through quick turnarounds and opportunity. Chael lays out why Joshua Van vs. Manel Kape is the right fight, right now — and why delaying it only hurts the division. Agree or disagree, one thing is clear: Manel Kape has done the work.

      "description": "Chael Sonnen explains why Jake Paul doesn’t need to beat Anthony Joshua to win this fight. In fact, according to Chael, the victory conditions for Jake are completely different than they are for Joshua. If Jake Paul makes it to round two, that’s a win. If he reaches round four, that’s a win. If he shows up, competes, avoids combinations, and proves he belongs in the ring — that’s a win. Chael breaks down how expectations shape perception, and why simply surviving, adapting, and landing even one meaningful moment would count as success for Jake Paul. On the other side, the pressure is entirely on Anthony Joshua. There is no moral victory. There is no narrative win. Joshua has one job: crush Jake Paul and get his hand raised. Anything less invites questions. This clip dives into the psychology of combat sports, mismatched expectations, and why certain fighters gain more from losing competitively than others do from winning. Chael lays out the asymmetry perfectly — and why fans need to understand it before the opening bell. If you’re following Jake Paul, Anthony Joshua, crossover boxing, and high-stakes fight narratives, this is essential Chael Sonnen analysis.",

      "description": "The debate around Petr Yan vs Merab Dvalishvili isn’t over — and Chael Sonnen breaks down why the conversation has shifted to scoring, fouls, and what should happen next. After the fight, Aljamain Sterling came out and said he had Merab winning the first three rounds. Chael reacts to that claim, along with the growing discussion around fence grabs, warnings, and why no point was ever deducted. If the fouls were serious enough to warn repeatedly, why wasn’t a point taken? And if some people truly believe Merab won the opening rounds, why isn’t there louder talk about running it back? Chael explains that this all comes down to how fans, judges, and fighters score MMA fights. He lays out his own card clearly: Petr Yan winning four of the five rounds. Not based on emotion, not based on effort — but on clean work, control, and effective offense. This clip dives into the gray areas of judging, referee discretion, and why close fights often create louder arguments after the final bell than during the action. It also raises the question no one seems eager to answer: if the fight was that close, why isn’t a trilogy already being discussed? If you want thoughtful analysis on UFC judging, Petr Yan, Merab Dvalishvili, and high-level fight scoring, this is classic Chael Sonnen perspective.",

      "description": "Go ahead and be a hater — Chael Sonnen says that’s part of being a fan. But one thing isn’t up for debate: Joshua Van is the world champion. In this breakdown, Chael explains why trying to diminish Van’s title win misses the entire point of competition. Chael addresses the criticism head-on. If this fight had ended a few minutes earlier or later, nobody would be questioning the result. Joshua Van was thrown into a brutally difficult situation, handled the pressure, and did exactly what champions do — he won. It doesn’t matter who looked better on paper or who fans think might win a rematch. What matters is who got their hand raised. This clip captures what championship moments are really about: opportunity, execution, and composure. Van seized his moment, and Chael makes it clear why that achievement deserves respect, not caveats. As for what comes next, Chael discusses a likely rematch with Alexandre Pantoja, why that makes sense, and why it shouldn’t be treated as automatic or dismissive of what Van already accomplished. If you want clear-eyed analysis on Joshua Van, UFC title fights, and why winning is the only currency that counts, this is classic Chael Sonnen perspective.",

      "description": "Merab Dvalishvili fought his heart out — and Chael Sonnen gives him full credit for it. Merab never backed down, mixed counter wrestling with relentless pressure, and showed a disciplined, fundamentals-first striking game. But at the championship level, effort alone isn’t enough. Chael breaks down why Petr Yan won the fight. Yan’s ability to blend striking and grappling forced Merab to fight everywhere at once. The threat of Yan’s takedown changed the entire striking dynamic — jabs and crosses land differently when your opponent has to worry about sprawling. That’s why Merab’s striking has looked better lately, and it’s also why Yan was able to neutralize it. This wasn’t about who the better striker was. It wasn’t about who the better wrestler was. As Chael explains, when you get to main events and world championship fights, the question becomes simple: who is the better mixed martial artist? On this night, it was Petr Yan. His ability to blend offense, defense, pressure, and discipline made the difference — and that’s what separates elite contenders from champions. If you’re looking for high-level MMA analysis on Merab Dvalishvili, Petr Yan, and championship-level fighting, this breakdown delivers exactly that.",

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL ! #bruntpoChaelBad The PFL says they’re working on “something special” for Francis Ngannou — but what does that actually mean? According to a recent article, the plan appears to hinge on Vadim Nemkov winning his upcoming fight. If Nemkov wins, the idea is that then something special happens for Francis. Chael Sonnen reads the statement four times and comes away with the same question you probably have: why does this need to wait? Chael breaks down why Francis Ngannou vs Nemkov could be made right now, why the matchup works regardless of Nemkov’s result, and why calling this scenario “special” feels misleading. These are two heavyweights under the same banner, in the same division, in a promotion that exists to put on cage fights — so where’s the surprise? Chael also explains why the outcome of Nemkov vs Ferreira shouldn’t determine Francis’s future, why Nemkov coming off a loss may actually complicate the story, and why fans have been asking for this fight since Nemkov left light heavyweight. The fight itself? Chael likes it. He hopes it happens. But calling it special sets expectations — and Chael isn’t sure those expectations are being met. So the real question becomes: What part of this plan is supposed to excite us? #FrancisNgannou #PFL #ChaelSonnen #MMA #Nemkov #MMATalk #Heavyweight #FightBusiness Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChaelBadBad Arman Tsarukyan was supposed to be next. So why does it feel like he’s still standing outside the title picture looking in? After missing a scheduled main event under circumstances the public never fully understood, questions started swirling about whether Tsarukyan quietly lost his place in line. Now, with Dana White saying there are “things we don’t talk about” and that Arman “knows what it is,” the conversation has been reignited. Chael Sonnen breaks down the full timeline—from the late-night call that scrapped the fight, to Arman being named backup fighter, to his win over Dan Hooker in what was publicly labeled a number-one contender bout. Chael explains why being a backup is usually a golden ticket, why history suggests the next fight should have been for the belt, and why this situation is more complicated than people want to admit. Is Tsarukyan actually being punished? Or is this just the reality of timing, interim titles, and a crowded lightweight division with names like Justin Gaethje, Paddy Pimblett, and Ilia Topuria in the mix? Chael also explains why staying active through grappling matches may be the smartest move Arman can make—and why, if the jury were up to him, Tsarukyan has already done enough to be back in the title conversation. #ArmanTsarukyan #ChaelSonnen #UFC #LightweightDivision #DanaWhite #MMATalk ##UFCDebate Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChaelBad Everybody keeps saying the same thing about Khamzat Chimaev moving to 205: “He needs time. He needs to gain weight. He needs to get bigger.” And Chael Sonnen is here to tell you—none of that makes any sense. In this video, Chael breaks down why the idea of Chimaev needing to bulk up for light heavyweight is one of MMA’s most persistent and least examined myths. If Chimaev can beat a guy at 185, he can beat that same guy at 205. And if he can’t beat him at 185, adding ten pounds of bodyweight isn’t magically going to change the outcome. Chael goes through every example: Ilia Topuria moved up without bulking and finished his opponent. Islam Makhachev moved up without adding size and delivered one of the most dominant title-fight performances ever. In the real world, gaining weight doesn’t equal gaining advantage—it just means training less and eating more, which has never improved a fighter’s chances. Plus, nobody at heavyweight talks about who’s 40 pounds bigger. So why are fans obsessed with Chimaev being 10 pounds lighter at 205? Chael asks the only question that matters: When has “bulking up” ever helped anyone in a fight? #KhamzatChimaev #AlexPereira #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMA #LightHeavyweight #FightAnalysis #WeightClasses Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Ilia Topuria was ready to accept being stripped, but the UFC said no and instead moved forward with an interim title. For the first time, Chael hears someone say that was the wrong call.

      "description": "Carlos Prates just called out Jack Della Maddalena — and Chael Sonnen wants to know the same thing you do: why? Is it fair game to call out a guy coming off a loss when that loss was for a world title? Chael says yes, absolutely… and then explains why fighters get this wrong all the time. Chael breaks down why card placement matters more than rankings, why calling up is always better than calling down, and why Prates targeting Jack actually makes complete career sense. He also ties in Brendan Allen calling out Dricus Du Plessis and how the middleweight and welterweight divisions are both wide open if you understand how the game really works. From Islam Makhachev’s options to Shavkat’s return, Ian Garry’s position, the rumors around Belal Muhammad, and whether Dana White promised Movsar a title shot — Chael walks through the whole 170 landscape and shows where Prates fits into it. But the real question is the one Chael wants Prates himself to answer: Why Jack? Is it the name? The position? A strategic play? Something personal? There’s no wrong answer — but Chael wants to hear it. #MMA #ChaelSonnen #UFCTalk #JackDella #CarlosPrates #UFC #Welterweight #FightBreakdownBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
