      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChael 170 pounds is murderers’ row, and that’s exactly why Islam Makhachev needs Kamaru Usman. Not just for a payday, not just for a name – for legacy. Chael breaks down the current state of the UFC welterweight division, from killers like Michael Morales, Sean Brady, Ian Garry, Belal Muhammad, and Shavkat Rakhmonov, to what really makes sense next for Islam. On paper, you can argue a lot of contenders… but when you factor in history, greatness, and what actually moves the needle, one name keeps coming back: Kamaru Usman. Chael explains why giving Usman a title shot isn’t just “rewarding” him for a dominant career – it might actually be the best thing you can do for Islam. If Makhachev goes out and does to Usman what even Khamzat Chimaev couldn’t, that changes the GOAT and pound-for-pound conversations overnight. We also get into Georges St-Pierre, Khabib Nurmagomedov, and how Islam’s resume will age as guys like Arman Tsarukyan rise to the top. This is a cold sport, and matchmaking at this level is about more than rankings. It’s about legacy, star power, and who you beat when it matters.

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChaelBad President Donald Trump just dropped a bombshell about the rumored UFC White House card – and whether he nailed every detail or not, the theme of what he said is wild. He floated June 14th, talked about nine title fights, and even used the phrase “only title fights.” Now, maybe one of those details is off… but if even one of them is right, everything changes. Chael breaks down what an all-title-fight card (or even an all-title-fight main card) would really mean. If it’s “only title fights,” where does that leave all the rumors we’ve heard about Conor McGregor, Jon Jones vs. Alex Pereira, and the heavyweight picture around Tom Aspinall and Ciryl Gane? Chael walks through how you could still make Conor a title fight with Max Holloway’s BMF belt, how Jones–Pereira could slide into a championship scenario, and what happens if Aspinall stays on the shelf long enough to force an interim or undisputed shake-up. This isn’t just fantasy matchmaking; it’s trying to read between the lines of what the host of the event is saying. If Trump is talking nine title fights and “only title fights,” even if the numbers are fuzzy, the direction is clear: the UFC is aiming for something historically stacked. Where does this all land? We’ll see. But it sure sounds like we’re in for a night loaded with gold.

      "description": "Get 15% OFF The House of Atlas Razor Kit + Before and After Set with the code CHAEL at https://www.houseofatlas.com/CHAEL! #houseofatlaspod Should Ilia Topuria still be the champion? That’s the question circling the UFC offices right now, and it’s a lot colder — and a lot more complicated — than fans realize. I just walked out of the UFC Performance Institute in Las Vegas, and everybody has an opinion on Ilia Topuria. Some say he’s the best boxer in MMA, others say he’s the future face of the sport, maybe even headlining the White House card. But for the first time, a very respected voice hit me with a different argument entirely: Ilia should have been stripped. Not sidelined. Not given grace. Stripped. This person walked me through the history of the interim title — why it exists, when it’s used, and why illness or injury has always been the deciding factor. They brought up Dominick Cruz’s three-and-a-half-year layoff, ACL after ACL, and the compassion that kept him champion. Their claim? Ilia’s situation doesn’t fall under illness or injury… so why keep the belt? Now, I don’t agree. I believe Ilia Topuria has handled a tough situation with transparency and courage. He even told the UFC to move on without him if needed — a man’s move. But the question remains: Should a champion keep his title if he refuses to fight and it’s not due to injury? This is the cold side of a cold sport. And it’s worth discussing. Drop your thoughts in the comments and watch more breakdowns on the channel. #UFC #IliaTopuria #MMA #ChaelSonnen #UFCTitle #CombatSportsBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

On this edition, he and MMA Junkie reporter Farah Hannoun discuss the following: (00:00) - Intro (01:39) - Petr Yan’s win over Merab Dvalishvili is more shocking than Joshua Van’s rise to the flyweight title. (08:59) - Both Merab and Pantoja’s next fights HAVE TO BE title fights. (14:16) - Henry Cejudo should’ve never retired the first time in 2020. (21:14) - Dana White and the UFC matchmakers are OUT OF LINE for how they’re treating Arman Tsarukyan. (28:29) - The UFC better not even THINK about giving Conor McGregor a welterweight title shot.

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChael Fighter of the Year isn’t a statistic. It’s an argument and Chael Sonnen isn’t afraid to make it. In this clip, Chael breaks down why he believes Joshua Van deserves serious consideration in the Fighter of the Year conversation — even while others point to Merab Dvalishvili’s year of title fights as the obvious pick. This isn’t a takedown of anyone. It’s a challenge to the way fans think about greatness. Chael compares championship moments, calendar-year performance, and consistency — explaining why “perfect” isn’t required to be dominant. Drawing from past debates and controversial picks, he shows how momentum, difficulty of opposition, and big moments matter just as much as undefeated records. The conversation also turns toward today’s hot topic: rematches. Chael explains why one future fight could completely change how the past is remembered — and why fans should be careful about rushing to judgment when careers are still being written. Whether you agree or disagree, this breakdown makes one thing clear: this isn’t about popularity. It’s about performance. If you love real fight debate, not clickbait, not hype but hard opinions backed by logic, this one is for you.

Was the victory over Merab Dvalishvili more about Yan’s stellar performance or the former champion biting off more than he can chew with his 4th fight in a calendar year? Does ’The Machine’ warrant an immediate rematch or should the UFC turn to a different opponent for Petr Yan? In the flyweight co main event, Alexandre Pantoja lost his title to Joshua Van due to an arm injury… how do the guy think Van should feel about winning his first championship in this fashion? Much like the main event, is an immediate rematch in store at flyweight? And, Triple C officially hangs up the gloves following his loss this past weekend… DC & Chael dive into what his legacy is to the sport. ✔️ Subscribe to ESPN Unlimited: https://plus.espn.com/ #ESPN",

      "description": "Bare-knuckle wrestling is intense, but Chael Sonnen argues that blaming the gloves is a massive copout. In this clip, he explains why fighters must be held accountable for actions like eye pokes, grabbing the fence, or kicking opponents while down — regardless of whether gloves are involved. Chael points out that referees and fans often label these incidents “unintentional,” but that mindset ignores responsibility. Even without gloves, fighters can and should avoid fouls. The real issue isn’t the equipment — it’s accountability. If someone pokes an opponent in the eye, someone is at fault, plain and simple. This clip is essential for anyone following MMA rules, bare-knuckle combat, or fighter safety. Chael’s analysis highlights how leniency for “accidents” undermines fairness, sets poor precedents, and affects how fights are judged. He stresses that proper enforcement and accountability maintain the integrity of the sport, rather than blaming gloves or equipment. For fans of MMA, bare-knuckle fighting, fighter safety, and insider fight analysis, this breakdown delivers Chael Sonnen’s sharp and unfiltered perspective.",

In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains why the odds made no sense, why Petr Yan was being dismissed far too easily, and why Merab Dvalishvili was walking into something much more dangerous than he expected. This wasn’t a wrestling match. This wasn’t a kickboxing match. This was mixed martial arts — and Yan fought it that way. Chael walks through what mattered: defensive underhooks, walking Merab down, the discipline of jabs and crosses, the lack of wasted motion, and the threat of wrestling that made every punch more dangerous. Yan didn’t throw everything. He committed to what worked. The conversation also breaks down the myth of “better striker vs better wrestler” and why that thinking gets fighters beat at the highest level. When championship fights happen, we don’t find out who’s the better grappler or striker — we find out who’s the better mixed martial artist. Merab fought like a champion. But Petr Yan fought like the man who had the answer. This wasn’t chaos. This was control. Only one kind of fighting wins at the top level… and Petr Yan just demonstrated it.

In this clip, Chael Sonnen breaks down how the UFC could handle one of the most explosive young talents in MMA. Rogan even clipped Steveson’s last fight and sent it directly to Dana White — a signal that this is a fighter you don’t ignore. Chael lays out the dilemma: Contender Series signings are one thing, but how do you introduce a fighter of Steveson’s caliber without wasting his talent or throwing him into an undercard he doesn’t belong on? Chael suggests a strategic approach: pay Steveson his worth, build him carefully, and consider a high-profile fight in another promotion like the PFL to gauge his readiness against elite opponents such as Francis Ngannou. If he wins, you’ve got a star ready for the big stage; if he doesn’t, you have your answer without risking your top talent. This clip is a must-watch for fans of Gable Steveson, Contender Series prospects, and UFC matchmaking strategies. Chael’s insights show the balance between building a fighter’s career, protecting the UFC’s investment, and keeping fans hyped.",

This was about showing up when you already know it’s over. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains why Henry Cejudo’s final fight mattered more than any belt he ever wore. When a fighter steps into the cage knowing there’s no return, something changes. Every shot hurts more. Every exchange costs more. And the only question left is simple: How bad do you want it? Chael walks through what happens psychologically when an athlete knows this is truly their last night — why most fighters freeze, why some collapse, and why very few rise. With a busted nose, a swollen eye, and the score slipping away, Henry never checked out. He leaned in. Then comes the bigger truth. The day of the pure wrestler is gone. This breakdown also exposes how the sport itself has evolved — from specialists to complete fighters. Wrestling alone no longer wins championships. Striking alone doesn’t either. The new era demands everything, all at once… and shows no mercy. Henry Cejudo didn’t quit. The sport simply moved forward. And this night proved it.

Was it the fight people expected? No. Was it clean? No. Was it the ending some fans wanted? Also no. But when the referee stepped in and raised a hand, Joshua Van stood as world champion. Chael walks through the pressure of that moment: standing in front of a live crowd, hearing reactions you didn’t choose, wearing a belt you didn’t imagine receiving this way — and handling it like a professional anyway. No celebration choreography. No victory script. Just procedure, spotlight, and judgment. This is not a conversation about being “better.” It’s a conversation about winning. Chael also addresses the push for rematches, the injury discussion, and the anger from people trying to rewrite the outcome. History doesn’t care how you win. It only records that you did. If you love fight analysis that cuts through emotions, excuses, and fantasy outcomes — this one matters. Only one thing matters in MMA. Joshua Van proved it.

      "description": "A UFC leak may have just confirmed a huge fight: Charles Oliveira versus Max Holloway for the BMF belt. Chael Sonnen breaks down what this leak means, why it matters, and how the UFC handles announcements when fighters speak first. According to Chael, the official UFC Brazil account briefly posted the news before deleting it — classic UFC style when they don’t control the narrative. Oliveira reportedly said he’s planning a match with Holloway for the BMF title, but didn’t give a date. He also mentioned he’s just a few fights away from being back in contention for a standard UFC title, meaning two or three wins could put him in prime position. Chael explains why Oliveira’s path makes sense: if he beats Holloway, he walks away with a belt and boosts his momentum in the lightweight division. This clip highlights the intersection of UFC politics, fighter ambition, and timing — and why leaks like this excite fans, shake up rankings, and keep the BMF conversation alive. If you’re following Charles Oliveira, Max Holloway, the BMF belt, or UFC lightweight title implications, this is a must-watch breakdown from Chael Sonnen.

      "description": "Arman Tsarukyan is making waves in the UFC, and Chael Sonnen is here to break down why his latest move matters. Fans have debated whether Tsarukyan got screwed out of a number one contender spot, but the situation is more nuanced than it appears. According to Chael, being “number one” doesn’t automatically lock in a title fight — it just means your next opportunity could be for the belt. What makes this moment exciting is Tsarukyan speaking up for himself. Instead of passively waiting, he’s now aiming high: he wants the BMF belt, and he’s willing to challenge Max Holloway for it. Chael explains why this is a smart, bold play — not only does it raise Tsarukyan’s profile, it also forces the UFC and fans to take notice of his intentions and skill. This clip highlights fighter strategy, divisional politics, and how a contender can leverage opportunities for maximum impact. Tsarukyan isn’t just sitting on a “golden ticket,” he’s actively shaping his path and making sure he gets the fights that matter. If you’re following Arman Tsarukyan, Max Holloway, UFC lightweight and featherweight dynamics, or want Chael’s sharp breakdowns of contender politics, this is a must-watch clip.

      "description": "Tom Aspinall didn’t fake anything — and Chael Sonnen is here to set the record straight. In this video, Chael asks a simple question: do some fans owe Tom Aspinall an apology? Because the heavyweight champ wasn’t just shaken up… he was legitimately hurt, and the situation could have cost him his belt over one wrong word. Chael breaks down the moment that sparked all the controversy: three eye pokes in under three minutes. That’s nearly one-third of the available fingers finding their way directly into Tom’s eye. Fans love to act like real fighters “would have continued,” but Chael explains why that mindset ignores the rules entirely. If Tom was hurt — and he clearly was — why wasn’t it a disqualification? Why do we always rush to call it “accidental” instead of acknowledging how egregious it actually was? This clip digs into fighter safety, the difference between accidental and reckless fouls, and the razor-thin line Tom walked as a champion. One wrong phrase to the referee and he could have lost his belt in a no-contest or forced stoppage. If you care about fairness, fighter protection, and the truth behind what really happened in the Octagon, this is essential Chael Sonnen analysis.

      "description": "Ilia Topuria and Islam Makhachev finally had a real reason to fight—yet somehow, the matchup has drifted even further apart. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains how Ilia managed to lose his ranking without ever losing a fight, and why that shift changes everything. Chael lays out the situation clearly: Ilia didn’t get beat, didn’t take damage, didn’t even stumble… yet he slips in the rankings and suddenly Islam has new directions to go. Instead of the long-hyped Ilia vs Islam showdown, the division now has fresh contenders. Islam Makhachev could be staring at a matchup with Kamaru Usman, a stylistic puzzle we’re not convinced Islam can solve. Meanwhile, Ilia Topuria may be heading toward Arman Tsarukyan, and fans aren’t confident Ilia gets over on a surging, dangerous Arman, either. The result? The fight everyone’s been circling for months has lost steam, lost urgency, and—according to Chael—lost its intrigue. The motivations are gone, the rankings have shifted, and both men now have bigger problems directly in front of them. If you’re following the chaos at lightweight and featherweight, or you want Chael’s unfiltered view on Islam Makhachev, Ilia Topuria, Kamaru Usman, and Arman Tsarukyan, this is the clip to watch.

      "description": "When you call out Jake Paul, timing matters—and this fighter picked the worst possible moment. Chael Sonnen breaks down why this move doesn’t just miss the mark… it actively damages the guy’s brand. In this clip, Chael reacts to a fighter openly flirting with a boxing match against Jake Paul while Jake is on the verge of facing Anthony Joshua. Instead of building momentum, he undercuts himself by suggesting the matchup would be “interesting” or “competitive” right before Jake steps into the biggest risk of his career. Chael lays out exactly why this is a disastrous strategy: you’re calling out a guy you can’t secure a contract with, who might get stopped by Joshua, and you’ve already told the public he’s on your level. The moment Jake loses, you lose your selling point. This is classic Chael—sharp, analytical, and brutally honest. He explains how timing, optics, and public perception make or break a potential boxing crossover. If you want a fight with a star, you don’t attach yourself to them right before a likely loss. You wait, position yourself, and elevate your own value. If you enjoy straight-talk breakdowns on Jake Paul, Anthony Joshua, boxing politics, and combat-sports marketing, this clip delivers.
