      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HfIXp3Bg4sg",
      "description": "A UFC leak may have just confirmed a huge fight: Charles Oliveira versus Max Holloway for the BMF belt. Chael Sonnen breaks down what this leak means, why it matters, and how the UFC handles announcements when fighters speak first. According to Chael, the official UFC Brazil account briefly posted the news before deleting it — classic UFC style when they don’t control the narrative. Oliveira reportedly said he’s planning a match with Holloway for the BMF title, but didn’t give a date. He also mentioned he’s just a few fights away from being back in contention for a standard UFC title, meaning two or three wins could put him in prime position. Chael explains why Oliveira’s path makes sense: if he beats Holloway, he walks away with a belt and boosts his momentum in the lightweight division. This clip highlights the intersection of UFC politics, fighter ambition, and timing — and why leaks like this excite fans, shake up rankings, and keep the BMF conversation alive. If you’re following Charles Oliveira, Max Holloway, the BMF belt, or UFC lightweight title implications, this is a must-watch breakdown from Chael Sonnen. Check out more insider analysis and UFC fight breakdowns right here.",

      "description": "Arman Tsarukyan is making waves in the UFC, and Chael Sonnen is here to break down why his latest move matters. Fans have debated whether Tsarukyan got screwed out of a number one contender spot, but the situation is more nuanced than it appears. According to Chael, being “number one” doesn’t automatically lock in a title fight — it just means your next opportunity could be for the belt. What makes this moment exciting is Tsarukyan speaking up for himself. Instead of passively waiting, he’s now aiming high: he wants the BMF belt, and he’s willing to challenge Max Holloway for it. Chael explains why this is a smart, bold play — not only does it raise Tsarukyan’s profile, it also forces the UFC and fans to take notice of his intentions and skill. This clip highlights fighter strategy, divisional politics, and how a contender can leverage opportunities for maximum impact. Tsarukyan isn’t just sitting on a “golden ticket,” he’s actively shaping his path and making sure he gets the fights that matter. If you’re following Arman Tsarukyan, Max Holloway, UFC lightweight and featherweight dynamics, or want Chael’s sharp breakdowns of contender politics, this is a must-watch clip.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/QL5M1hePDv0",
      "description": "Tom Aspinall didn’t fake anything — and Chael Sonnen is here to set the record straight. In this video, Chael asks a simple question: do some fans owe Tom Aspinall an apology? Because the heavyweight champ wasn’t just shaken up… he was legitimately hurt, and the situation could have cost him his belt over one wrong word. Chael breaks down the moment that sparked all the controversy: three eye pokes in under three minutes. That’s nearly one-third of the available fingers finding their way directly into Tom’s eye. Fans love to act like real fighters “would have continued,” but Chael explains why that mindset ignores the rules entirely. If Tom was hurt — and he clearly was — why wasn’t it a disqualification? Why do we always rush to call it “accidental” instead of acknowledging how egregious it actually was? This clip digs into fighter safety, the difference between accidental and reckless fouls, and the razor-thin line Tom walked as a champion. One wrong phrase to the referee and he could have lost his belt in a no-contest or forced stoppage. If you care about fairness, fighter protection, and the truth behind what really happened in the Octagon, this is essential Chael Sonnen analysis.

      "description": "Ilia Topuria and Islam Makhachev finally had a real reason to fight—yet somehow, the matchup has drifted even further apart. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains how Ilia managed to lose his ranking without ever losing a fight, and why that shift changes everything. Chael lays out the situation clearly: Ilia didn’t get beat, didn’t take damage, didn’t even stumble… yet he slips in the rankings and suddenly Islam has new directions to go. Instead of the long-hyped Ilia vs Islam showdown, the division now has fresh contenders. Islam Makhachev could be staring at a matchup with Kamaru Usman, a stylistic puzzle we’re not convinced Islam can solve. Meanwhile, Ilia Topuria may be heading toward Arman Tsarukyan, and fans aren’t confident Ilia gets over on a surging, dangerous Arman, either. The result? The fight everyone’s been circling for months has lost steam, lost urgency, and—according to Chael—lost its intrigue. The motivations are gone, the rankings have shifted, and both men now have bigger problems directly in front of them. If you’re following the chaos at lightweight and featherweight, or you want Chael’s unfiltered view on Islam Makhachev, Ilia Topuria, Kamaru Usman, and Arman Tsarukyan, this is the clip to watch.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kQ2VkXMWn_I",
      "description": "When you call out Jake Paul, timing matters—and this fighter picked the worst possible moment. Chael Sonnen breaks down why this move doesn’t just miss the mark… it actively damages the guy’s brand. In this clip, Chael reacts to a fighter openly flirting with a boxing match against Jake Paul while Jake is on the verge of facing Anthony Joshua. Instead of building momentum, he undercuts himself by suggesting the matchup would be “interesting” or “competitive” right before Jake steps into the biggest risk of his career. Chael lays out exactly why this is a disastrous strategy: you’re calling out a guy you can’t secure a contract with, who might get stopped by Joshua, and you’ve already told the public he’s on your level. The moment Jake loses, you lose your selling point. This is classic Chael—sharp, analytical, and brutally honest. He explains how timing, optics, and public perception make or break a potential boxing crossover. If you want a fight with a star, you don’t attach yourself to them right before a likely loss. You wait, position yourself, and elevate your own value. If you enjoy straight-talk breakdowns on Jake Paul, Anthony Joshua, boxing politics, and combat-sports marketing, this clip delivers.

Alexandre gives Van flowers for his confidence and fighting skill this early into his MMA and UFC career and says HE KNEW Van would be his next fight after the victory over Kai Kara-France. Plus, DC talks to Pantoja about the GOAT debate in the flyweight division, and how he's on his way to rivaling the great Demetrious Johnson if he can keep stringing wins together late in his career.

Sign-up using https://dkng.co/sonnen or through my promo code SONNEN Chael Sonnen breaks down one of MMA’s most misunderstood topics: weight cutting. But he doesn’t just skim the surface — he calls out the myths, the medical “experts,” and the endless pretend conversations that ignore the only data that actually matters. From NCAA rule changes to the psychology of cutting, Chael explains why fighters and wrestlers are the healthiest athletes in the world… and why most fans and officials still get this issue completely wrong. Then Chael pivots to another long-running debate in the sport: eye pokes. Are they accidental? Are they avoidable? Or have we all just agreed to pretend something else is happening? Chael lays out the truth as only he can, comparing MMA to wrestling, judo, and bare knuckle while arguing that accountability — not gloves, rules committees, or redesigns — is the only real fix. If you care about fighter safety, rule enforcement, or the evolution of the sport, this is classic Chael: sharp, honest, and impossible to ignore. #ChaelSonnen #UFCRules #WeightCutting #EyePokes #MMA #MixedMartialArts #UCFFighters #CombatSports Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Don’t miss out on all the action this week at DraftKings! Download the DraftKings app today! Sign-up using https://dkng.co/sonnen or through my promo code SONNEN Damon Martin just dropped a take so wild that Chael Sonnen had to stop, rewind, and ask the world one simple question: What are we even talking about here? In this clip, Chael breaks down why calling potential “massive superfights” for Merab Dvalishvili at featherweight isn’t just wrong — it’s fundamentally illogical. Chael walks through the entire argument step-by-step, comparing divisions, drawing parallels to real-world logic, and highlighting why a champion at 135 should, in theory, have the biggest opportunities in his own weight class. Yet Damon’s headline suggests the opposite: that somehow a non-drawing champion at 145 — a fighter not headlining or even co-headlining — is supposed to create a bigger fight for Merab than anyone in his own division. Chael isn’t buying it, and he’s asking Damon to “show his work.” This segment dives into business realities, star power, PPV placement, and the simple math of what actually makes a fight big. If you want a masterclass in MMA logic, this is Chael at his sharpest — funny, irritated, and surgical.

Sign-up using https://dkng.co/sonnen or through my promo code SONNEN DraftKings just released the official betting odds for Merab Dvalishvili vs Petr Yan — and Chael says the numbers completely shocked him. Is Merab really a -425 favorite? Is Yan really a +330 underdog after stuffing 44 takedowns in their first fight? Chael breaks down the perception around the matchup, why fans think it was “rushed,” and the truth behind their first five-round war that most people forgot was even a rematch. He also explains the single adjustment Yan needs to finally flip the script — and why DraftKings may have just taken the pressure off of him entirely.

Sign-up using https://dkng.co/sonnen or through my promo code SONNEN UFC 323 is loaded, but Chael breaks down why a world title fight is sitting in the co-main event and why almost nobody is talking about it. In this clip, Chael tells an incredible behind-the-scenes story from The Ultimate Fighter Brazil with Wanderlei Silva and how Paul Heyman once gave him the most important promotional lesson of his career: “When you can’t work with someone… shoot on the son of a bitch.” That moment sets the stage for what Chael sees happening right now with Alexandre Pantoja and Josh Van. The fight is elite. The athletes are elite. But the promotion isn’t. And Chael explains exactly why that matters. He dives into the DraftKings odds, the matchup itself, and the challenge of selling a co-main event when the fighters refuse to take creative control of their careers. Chael compares this moment to examples like Dricus Du Plessis, Demetrious Johnson, and others who understood how to make themselves impossible to ignore. If you're a fighter, a fan, or someone who wants to understand the business behind the UFC, this clip is a masterclass in why promotion is everything — and why being a world champion isn’t enough if you can’t get people to tune in. 👍 Like, comment, and subscribe for more Chael-style breakdowns.

Sign-up using https://dkng.co/sonnen or through my promo code SONNEN Henry Cejudo said something simple about the eye poke situation: “Man up. Make a call.” And Chael Sonnen agrees. In this video, Chael breaks down exactly why the UFC is stuck in no-man’s-land when it comes to fouls, rulings, and the consequences that follow. Chael explains why eye pokes, headbutts, restarts, and no-contests aren’t just “accidents” — they shape careers, affect fighter contracts, change opportunities, and stall divisions. From Tom Aspinall losing momentum to the heavyweight division grinding to a halt, Chael reveals why the lack of consistency is killing anticipation, the very thing the fight business runs on. This isn’t about who hit harder or who landed more. It’s about conflict, resolution, and closure. And when the UFC doesn’t make a call, everyone pays for it. Chael dives into historical examples, from Holyfield vs Tyson to Aljo vs Yan, and explains why only one thing fixes the sport: real rules, real consequences, and refs with the guts to enforce them. 🔥 If you care about UFC judging, fouls, fairness, and fighter safety — this is a must-watch breakdown. #UFC #ChaelSonnen #MMA #EyePoke #TomAspinall #HenryCejudo #UFCRules Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
