      "description": "Fresh off the Apex in Vegas, I’m reacting to reports that Jake Paul’s next fight might shift—and the rumored opponents include Nate Diaz or even Francis Ngannou. After the Tank Davis situation and Netflix chatter, what’s real, what’s hype, and what actually makes sense for Jake Paul? I break it down, give credit where it’s due, and say exactly why a Francis fight is… unlikely. What do you think—Diaz, Ngannou, or someone else?

      "description": "'WE'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE!' We just walked out of the Apex and… what a night. Daniel Cormier and I were still processing it in the car: one of the strangest eye-poke sequences we’ve ever seen—stoppage signaled, replay checked, then a restart that flipped the entire fight on its head. Yes, people will compare it to last week’s Tom Aspinall vs Ciryl Gane situation, but the circumstances were very different. Don’t lump them together. Waldo Cortes-Acosta fought through limited vision, came back furious after the restart, and closed the show—insane composure and power. Credit to the ref for using the replay signal decisively and getting it right under pressure. Main event? Steve Garcia looked sensational—educated pressure, slick head movement, cage cutting, and serious pop. David Onama is tough to finish, and Garcia still found the answer. He even tossed a callout up the ladder. Whether that’s next or not, keep that name circled. Elsewhere: tight decision battles, a slick submission, and an undefeated prospect causing Twitter to melt down with “fix” talk. I called the fight—didn’t look like that to me. Sometimes a new, well-rounded guy just arrives. I grabbed a late flight so I can wake up at home instead of waking up… rough. Quick debrief now, longer breakdown soon. Drop your thoughts below: Did the officials handle the eye-poke sequence perfectly? And who should Garcia fight next? 🔒 Become a Member for special Perks, Exclusive Content and ultra-exclusive Live Chats: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrG2_1TcVkXKXXsD6Kjwig/join ▶️ Follow Michael on Social: https://www.instagram.com/mikebisping https://www.twitter.com/bisping https://www.facebook.com/mikethecountbisping ▶️ Edited by John Brannigan: https://www.instagram.com/johnbranniganuk https://www.twitter.com/johnbranniganuk #bisping #ufc #mma #mixedmartialarts #michaelbisping #ufcnews #mmanews #ufcvegas110",

Along the way, Bisping shares behind-the-scenes stories, including being cageside in Mexico when chaos broke out and bottles started flying, and gives his take on why the fighters who get fouled are often the ones fans turn on. 👉 What do you think is the worst foul in UFC history?
