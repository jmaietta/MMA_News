      "description": "Is Arman Tsarukyan the hottest name in MMA right now? Chael Sonnen thinks he might be — and it’s not even close. Tsarukyan isn’t just winning fights. He’s winning attention. Headlines. Clicks. Momentum. Somehow, he’s generating more buzz than Ilia Topuria — and Topuria’s a world champion. From dominant performances to viral moments (yes, even the food challenges), Arman has turned himself into must-watch content without even fighting. But here’s where it gets interesting. Tsarukyan came out and said if there’s a logjam at lightweight, fine — he’ll just drop to featherweight and fight for that belt instead. No begging. No waiting. No politics. Just opportunity hunting. Chael breaks down why that mindset is dangerous for the rest of the division. We’ve seen pushback before when champs or contenders move up. Even Topuria had to “prove himself” at 155. Khabib Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev weren’t quick to hand out opportunities. But Arman’s playing this differently — he’s publicly showing he doesn’t care who says no. And that confidence? That’s leverage. When a guy is willing to fight anybody, anywhere, any weight — the UFC usually finds a way to say yes. Is Tsarukyan about to force his way into a title shot… or even two divisions?",

      "description": "I’m not overthinking this one — I’m taking Alexander Volkanovski. Chael Sonnen breaks down the rematch with Diego Lopes and makes a simple point: they already fought, and there was nothing controversial about it. Five clear rounds. Dominant. Decisive. Volk controlled the pace, the pressure, and the fight from start to finish. So why are people suddenly acting like this is a toss-up? Yes, Lopes hits hard. And yes, power is always the great equalizer. Chael admits that’s the one danger — because the only times we’ve seen Volkanovski lose, it came from someone landing something big. But beating Volk isn’t just about power. It’s about matching — and exceeding — his pace for 25 minutes. That’s a different problem entirely. Very few fighters in the world can even attempt that. Islam Makhachev did. Most can’t. Ilia Topuria didn’t match the pace — he just found the shot. That’s lightning in a bottle, not a strategy. If Lopes is going to win, it has to be with one punch. Because round after round? That’s Volkanovski’s world. Sometimes the smart pick is the obvious one.",

Colby Covington calling out Paddy Pimblett wasn’t on anyone’s bingo card — but Chael Sonnen doesn’t hate it. In this breakdown, Chael reacts to Colby Covington calling out Paddy Pimblett for a potential White House card. It’s a matchup that crosses weight classes, rankings, and expectations — which is exactly why Chael finds it interesting. Chael explains why cross-division callouts usually don’t happen, why fans love them when they do, and how this fight could actually benefit Paddy at a crucial moment in his career. After tasting title-fight attention, most fighters want one thing: to get back. A fight with Covington would instantly deliver relevance, spotlight, and pressure relief — even if it means stepping outside Paddy’s natural division. The conversation also touches on the criticism surrounding Paddy’s last performance, Colby’s blunt assessment, and why chaos fights sometimes arrive at the perfect time. Chael shares behind-the-scenes insight, including why Bo Nickal and Colby might be circling each other — and why momentum, not rankings, often drives these moments. Is it realistic? Maybe not. Is it fascinating? Absolutely. And that’s why Chael Sonnen loves talking about it.

In this wide-ranging Q&A, Chael weighs in on the greatest talkers in pro wrestling history, explaining why the debate ultimately comes down to The Rock versus Stone Cold Steve Austin, and why their greatness came from very different strengths. Chael also shares blunt thoughts on legacy names like Ric Flair and Dusty Rhodes — and why nostalgia sometimes rewrites history. The discussion then shifts to modern combat sports. Chael addresses growing speculation around Colby Covington versus Bo Nickal, confirming real interest behind the scenes and explaining why the matchup makes sense — especially in the context of a potential White House card. One of the most revealing moments comes when Chael reacts to comments from Kevin Lee about losing competitive drive after watching Ilia Topuria train and rise. Chael relates deeply, explaining how seeing the next generation surpass your ceiling can be one of the hardest realities in sport. Chael also gives shine to underappreciated wrestlers from his own era, offers behind-the-scenes insight into RFA, and weighs whether a Justin Gaethje vs Ilia Topuria clash belongs on the White House stage.

Chael Sonnen tells a story about watching a near-perfect post-fight promo on UFC Fight Pass — and then watching the fighter take one fatal detour. While traveling and watching fights, Chael sees a lightweight grab the mic with a polished, rehearsed message that somehow sounds natural. The delivery is smooth. The structure is right. There’s even a clear call-to-action aimed directly at Dana White: “Get your checkbook.” Then it goes sideways. Chael explains why teasing or “attacking the boss” is the quickest way to sabotage your own opportunity — especially when you’re trying to get hired by the very people you’re calling out. The moment goes viral, MMA media piles on, and Dana White responds publicly with the harsh truth: if you’re going to cut a promo like that, you’d better have just had a great fight — and this wasn’t one. Chael breaks down what worked, what didn’t, and the real lesson for fighters: save the big promo for the moment you’ve earned it… and get better advisers.

      "description": "Dan Hooker versus Benoît Saint Denis looks explosive on paper — but according to Chael Sonnen, the matchup heavily favors Hooker. While many fans expect Saint Denis to drag this fight to the ground, Chael explains why that game plan may not be realistic, especially over three rounds. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen walks through the key stylistic clash between Dan Hooker and Benoît Saint Denis, focusing on output, durability, and where each fighter is most dangerous. Saint Denis brings pressure, power, and endurance — but beating Hooker requires something very specific: overwhelming grappling control. And that’s where Chael sees the problem. Hooker is comfortable on the feet, hard to hurt, and no longer the vulnerable wrestler many fans remember from earlier in his career. After battles with elite grapplers, Hooker has proven he can survive bad positions, keep output high, and turn adversity into momentum. In a three-round fight, Chael believes those traits matter more than ever. This is a classic endurance matchup, but when championship rounds are taken off the table, Chael argues the advantage shifts decisively. Expect exchanges, pressure, and moments — but don’t be surprised if Hooker’s pace and comfort in chaos make the difference.

      "description": "Alexander Volkanovski and Diego Lopez don’t require guesswork — they already fought. And according to Chael Sonnen, that matters more than any theory or hype heading into the rematch. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains why Alexander Volkanovski remains the clear favorite against Diego Lopes, despite questions about momentum, narrative, and opportunity. Their first meeting wasn’t controversial. It wasn’t close. Volkanovski controlled the pace, the positioning, and the conditioning across five dominant rounds. Chael acknowledges why the fight was made again — someone in a decision-making role believes there’s a better version of Lopez. A more aggressive version. A version willing to pressure Volkanovski instead of reacting to him. That belief alone is enough to make the matchup interesting. But belief isn’t evidence. For Lopez to win, Chael argues he must do something only a few fighters in the world have managed: out-pressure Volkanovski. Not match his pace — exceed it. And that requires elite conditioning, sustained aggression, and the willingness to walk forward without hesitation. In their first fight, Lopez didn’t do that. He allowed Volkanovski to lead, to control the dance, and to dictate every exchange. With limited time between fights, Chael questions whether Lopez could realistically make the conditioning leap required to reverse the outcome. Power always gives a fighter a chance — but history shows Volkanovski only loses when he’s put down decisively. That’s why Chael Sonnen is making the same pick again.

Alexander Volkanovski returned to the featherweight title picture under circumstances that made no sense on paper — and that’s exactly why the moment mattered. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains why Volkanovski’s championship opportunity was questioned, why the criticism was fair, and why the outcome changed everything. After knockout losses at featherweight and lightweight, Volkanovski found himself back in a title fight not by climbing the ladder, but because the division shifted. That reality created discomfort, debate, and pressure — the kind of pressure champions either collapse under or use to define their legacy. Chael Sonnen argues that telling the story honestly is what allowed Volkanovski to have a truly great moment. When a fighter is doubted, dismissed, or framed as undeserving, victory doesn’t just win a belt — it silences a narrative. Sonnen draws comparisons to legendary moments in combat sports where veterans were written off, only to remind the world who they really were. This is not about disrespect. It’s about stakes, storytelling, and why difficult narratives create the biggest champions. Volkanovski didn’t just win a fight — he completed the story that made the win matter. Watch for a sharp breakdown of matchmaking, media pressure, and why controversy is sometimes the greatest gift a champion can receive.

      "description": "Justin Gaethje didn’t reinvent himself — he reminded everyone who he’s always been. In this clip, Chael Sonnen breaks down Gaethje’s relentless, Terminator-style pressure against Paddy Pimblett. No tricks. No surprises. Just forward motion, nonstop pressure, and a gas tank that never quits. While plenty of fighters try to walk opponents down, almost nobody has the lungs to do it for 15 hard minutes. Justin does — and that’s what breaks people. Every step backward drains you. Every punch loses steam. Suddenly your offense isn’t sharp anymore. That’s the Gaethje effect. The commentary team called it “vintage Gaethje,” but Chael disagrees — this wasn’t old Justin. This is just Justin. The same guy who’s always marched forward, eaten shots, and made fights ugly until opponents fold. Now the bigger question: what’s next? Do you wait around for Ilia Topuria, or do you keep the division moving? Chael argues the urgency isn’t the same — and a matchup with Arman Tsarukyan suddenly makes a lot of sense. Because when Gaethje fights, you don’t stall. You capitalize. If you forgot how dangerous Justin Gaethje is, this performance was your reminder.",

Sonnen explains why immediate (or near-immediate) rematches usually happen — controversy, injury, a flash finish — and why this case is different. Volkanovski didn’t just beat Lopes; he won every round the first time. That’s what makes the rematch fascinating… and risky. If it goes 5-0 again, Sonnen argues the sport is forced to answer whether this matchup should’ve been run back at all. He also digs into what fans consistently underrate about Volkanovski: pace. Not just cardio — pace as a weapon, the same way a handful of all-time greats used it to break opponents psychologically. Sonnen then flips it to Lopes and asks the only question bettors are really asking: if Lopes is going to win, does it almost have to be a knockout?

      "description": "Follow Misha on Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/mishaparsons Chael Sonnen shares a Bad Guy Inc. story from fight week that has nothing to do with punches — and everything to do with character. With Oban Elliott in Australia preparing to compete after a year of cancelled fights and disrupted camps, Sonnen explains why Elliott has always been built for chaos. A former railroad worker who trained after exhausting shifts just to chase the UFC dream, Elliott isn’t the type that folds when plans change — he adjusts and keeps moving. Sonnen then tells what happened when Misha Parsons, Bad Guy Inc.’s 18-year-old photographer traveling solo with her camera, tried to get access for photos. She was turned away at first — and later approached Alexander Volkanovski directly with the same request. Even with credentials in hand, she was told no. Sonnen is careful not to accuse Volkanovski of anything, acknowledging the stress and nonstop demands that come with fight week. But he admits it felt personal, because Chael’s name was part of the ask. Then comes the contrast. Sonnen reaches out to Oban Elliott — expecting delays, managers, logistics. Instead, Elliott responds immediately, tells her directly: “You are part of the team,” gets her a wristband, and gives full access — even to moments fighters usually protect, like the weight cut. Sonnen’s takeaway is simple: MMA doesn’t just build character — sometimes it reveals it. And Oban Elliott revealed his. #UFC #ObanElliott #AlexanderVolkanovski #MMA #ChaelSonnen #FightWeek #BadGuyInc Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Chael Sonnen breaks down the fallout from Justin Gaethje vs Paddy Pimblett and why one win may have quietly scrambled multiple UFC plans at lightweight. In this video, Sonnen reacts to the backlash around the fight’s “sloppy” label, including comments from Arman Tsarukyan, then pivots to the real question: what do you do with Gaethje and Pimblett now? Sonnen also tackles the ongoing confusion around what an interim title actually means in today’s UFC landscape, using the recent Tom Aspinall / Jon Jones situation as the example that changed how fans view the belt. Sonnen then shares his perspective on the matchmaking ripple effects involving Conor McGregor, including why weight (155 vs a higher number) matters more than fans want to admit, and how a belt complicates everything. He explains why Ilia Topuria may be the happiest person in the division right now, how Tsarukyan’s position gets affected, and why Pimblett remains a massive star even coming off a loss. Finally, Sonnen floats a practical next step that keeps the division moving: Paddy Pimblett vs the winner of Benoît Saint Denis vs Dan Hooker—and asks the audience if it passes the smell test.

      "description": "You can go to my partner https://kalshi.com/chael and get $10 when you trade $100. Chael Sonnen examines whether Arman Tsarukyan has become the hottest fighter in the UFC — not just inside the Octagon, but in the media, headlines, and online conversation. In this breakdown, Chael explains how Tsarukyan has quietly taken control of the narrative at lightweight, generating more attention and discussion than nearly anyone else in the division. From viral moments to unexpected food-related clips, Tsarukyan has found a way to stay relevant while the title picture at 155 pounds remains jammed. The discussion centers on Tsarukyan’s recent statement that he is the clear number one contender — and that if the lightweight division is stalled, he is willing to drop to 145 pounds to fight for a championship. Sonnen explains why statements like this matter once they’re said publicly, how they force responses from champions and contenders, and why Tsarukyan may be more serious than fans initially believe. Sonnen also questions whether moving to featherweight actually solves a problem or simply shifts the logjam to another division already crowded with deserving contenders. He compares the situation to past debates about champions moving weight classes and whether bigger fighters should be allowed to skip the line. While Sonnen ultimately believes Tsarukyan will be fine staying at lightweight, he praises the strategy for what it is: smart pressure, smart media control, and a way to make it clear that Tsarukyan refuses to wait quietly. The question now is simple — do fans still love the idea after thinking about it for a day? #UFC #ArmanTsarukyan #MMA #UFCLightweight #UFCFeatherweight #ChaelSonnen #FightBusiness Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KwZw4kSldk",
      "description": "Chael Sonnen reflects on one of the most difficult and confusing moments in the career of Rose Namajunas, a multi-time UFC champion and future Hall of Famer who has repeatedly found herself in situations few champions ever face. In this video, Sonnen explains why Rose’s career defies logic on paper. Despite dominant wins, clean knockouts, and clear title defenses, she has repeatedly been forced into immediate rematches after victories that were neither controversial nor competitive. Sonnen compares her career path to riddles seen on the men’s side of the sport, where outcomes and opportunities often fail to align. Sonnen breaks down Rose’s most recent fight, a competitive bout that he personally believed she won, only to see the judges’ decision — and the reaction of a 17,000-person live audience — tell a different story. While Sonnen is careful not to diminish her opponent’s achievement, he raises an unavoidable question: when the judges and the crowd disagree, and a former champion loses a third title-eliminator opportunity, what comes next? The discussion also touches on Rose’s decision to move weight classes, the physical toll of the fight — including a torn thumb — and the emotional weight of competing on a massive stage where millions are watching. This isn’t a debate about judging. It’s a deeper look at fairness, timing, and how unforgiving MMA can be — even to its greatest champions. #UFC #RoseNamajunas #MMA #FightAnalysis #ChaelSonnen #WomensMMABad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "After UFC 324, the big question is simple: what does Paddy Pimblett do next? After a brutal five-round loss to Justin Gaethje, Paddy proved what many doubters questioned — his toughness, heart, and refusal to quit at the elite level. But if the goal is still to become UFC champion, changes are needed. From tightening up his striking defense and boxing fundamentals to making a serious investment in wrestling, this breakdown looks at what Paddy did right, what went wrong, and how he evolves from here. With the lightweight rankings taking shape, one matchup stands out above the rest — Paddy Pimblett vs Dan Hooker. Ranked back-to-back, real heat, real stakes, and a guaranteed war. Is this the perfect next fight, or am I out of my mind?

      "description": "Dana White just made a major change to the UFC bonus system. The traditional discretionary bonuses — where fighters across the card received checks ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 — are officially gone. Now, only finishes earn a $25,000 bonus, changing how fighters get rewarded after every event. This move could completely reshape: • Fighter incentives • Fight strategies • Risk-taking in the cage • Pay structure across the card 💬 Is this better for fighters — or worse? Should UFC reward performance or only finishes? 👇 Drop your take in the comments. #UFC #DanaWhite #MMA #UFCPay #UFCSalary #FightBonus #CombatSports Website: http://www.MMAWeekly.com/ Subscribe on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=MMAWeeklyVideos Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MMAWeeklycom-176775391774/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/MMAWeeklycom/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mmaweekly/",
