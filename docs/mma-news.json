Strickland says he’s the only man who can beat Khamzat Chimaev and even claims “Fluffy” Hernandez is a better wrestler than Chimaev. Khamzat Chimaev is undefeated, a dominant force at middleweight, and now looks like his cardio issues are solved after going five rounds. If Chimaev fights next, it should be Nassourdine Imavov — unless the winner of Sean Strickland vs Brendan “Fluffy” Hernandez jumps the line. Strickland talks, Chimaev dominates, and Dricus Du Plessis needs to defend the UFC middleweight title soon.
