Daniel Cormier IS BACK to give his reaction to the viral video revealing Jon's injuries, and why \"it's a sad day\" to see Jones is finally doing fighting in the sport. DC GOES IN ON why he thinks there's NO WAY Jones will wrestle him after this news came out, and that we should get ready to now see the end of Jones' career in the UFC. See why Cormier thinks Jon is actually okay with the news coming out, despite his public comments claiming he didn't know he was being filmed. And with Justin Gaethje vs. Ilia Topuria almost certainly headlining the White House, DC gives his take on the future UFC title fight.
