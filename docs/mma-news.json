Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Conor McGregor says his UFC contract may no longer exist — and that claim changes everything. In this video, Chael Sonnen examines McGregor’s public statement that the UFC’s Paramount deal voided his existing contract and explains why, regardless of legal technicalities, the claim itself matters. If a fighter asserts there is no deal, the promotion cannot simply move forward as if one exists. Chael walks through how the UFC historically handles contract disputes, why litigation is rarely the path taken, and how recent developments — including the sudden removal of McGregor from a proposed White House card — give unexpected weight to McGregor’s position. While the legal argument may be weak on paper, the real-world consequences are not. The breakdown also explores the ripple effects on the event itself, the uncertainty surrounding the White House card, and why Michael Chandler appears caught in the middle of a larger negotiation strategy. With suspension timelines, promotional commitments, and public messaging all colliding, this has become one of the strangest booking situations the UFC has faced in years. This isn’t prediction or hype. It’s an examination of what the available facts actually suggest — and why the situation may be far more unresolved than it appears.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Being the best fighter and being the biggest star are not the same thing — and the UFC has never pretended otherwise. In this video, Chael Sonnen breaks down what actually defines the biggest star in the UFC. It isn’t rankings. It isn’t belts. And it isn’t who would win a fantasy matchup on paper. It’s who moves people, fills buildings, and commands attention the moment they walk into an arena. Sonnen explains how the UFC signals its priorities, why audience reaction matters more than technical dominance, and how production choices, walkouts, and crowd participation reveal who the company is truly backing. He also examines why some fighters dominate headlines without dominating divisions — and why that distinction is intentional. The conversation touches on recent media narratives, star-making moments, and the difference between being respected inside the sport and being relevant outside of it. Sonnen outlines how stars are built, how they’re protected, and why “best fighter” arguments often miss the point entirely. This isn’t a prediction. It’s an explanation. If the question is who the UFC revolves around — not who wins rounds, but who drives the business — this is where the answer lives.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? A headline coming out of weigh-ins claimed Patty Pimblett held a size advantage over Justin Gaethje. That claim doesn’t survive even a basic look at how weight classes actually work. Both fighters weighed in at 155 pounds. That’s not a suggestion, not a range — it’s a hard number. At that point, size advantages don’t exist. Lightweight is lightweight. Enough is enough. In this video, Chael Sonnen breaks down why face-off photos and surface-level narratives keep misleading fans during fight week. He explains how gyms actually separate athletes by real size, why fighters within certain ranges are effectively the same weight, and why “size advantage” headlines often collapse under scrutiny. The conversation also explores the strange incentives created by modern weight cutting, why weigh-ins have become more theatrical than functional, and how post-weigh-in rehydration blurs reality even further. This isn’t about criticizing fighters or reporters. It’s about precision. If a claim can’t hold up to basic logic, it shouldn’t be repeated — no matter how good it sounds in a headline.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Cameron Smotherman made weight — and then his body gave out. He stepped on the scale at 135.5 pounds, officially cleared the limit, took a few steps, and collapsed moments later. No theatrics. No exaggeration. Just a visible example of what extreme weight cutting can look like when the margin disappears. The moment wasn’t about the fall itself. It was about the fact that Smotherman still made weight. That detail matters. Whatever misery the cut required, whatever strain it placed on the body, the job was finished before the system failed. That is toughness — and it also highlights a problem the sport continues to acknowledge without meaningfully fixing. This issue has been solved before. The NCAA ended extreme weight cutting decades ago, not through discussion panels or medical speculation, but by changing the weigh-in window. When athletes were required to compete shortly after weighing in, dehydration stopped immediately. The incentive disappeared. A weigh-in held a full day before competition is no longer functional. It serves marketing purposes, not competitive ones. Fighters rehydrate, reconstitute, and often enter the cage at drastically different weights than what was measured. Fighters are adults, and they will always pursue advantages within the rules. But there is a cost — and this time, that cost was caught on video. The hope is that Smotherman is healthy and recovers fully. The larger hope is that moments like this finally lead to action instead of repetition.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Fight week usually follows a familiar script. Certain names dominate the conversation, certain questions get asked, and certain narratives take over the room. This time, Chael Sonnen found himself genuinely stumped — and that doesn’t happen often. In this clip, Chael works through a deceptively simple question: Who actually has to be on the rumored White House card? What starts as a thought exercise quickly turns into a deeper breakdown of timing, leverage, availability, and how the UFC really builds landmark events. Rather than speculating wildly, Chael sticks to what can be observed — who is penciled in, who isn’t, and why some obvious names don’t actually make sense once you look at dates, divisions, and championship obligations. Along the way, Chael addresses fighters like Max Holloway, Michael Chandler, Jon Jones, and Gable Steveson, explaining why popularity alone doesn’t guarantee placement — and why some divisions, particularly heavyweight, remain unresolved heading into a potential tentpole event. This isn’t about predictions or inside promises. It’s about understanding how UFC media days work, why certain fights get momentum, and how silence can sometimes tell you more than headlines. If you follow fight-week coverage, card construction, or the business logic behind major UFC events, this breakdown offers a clear-eyed look at what actually matters — and what doesn’t. Watch the full analysis and decide for yourself who truly belongs on a White House card.

Lewis explains why he sees Waldo as a “different version of Roy Nelson,” calls him a one-trick pony built around the right hand, and says he expects to get him out of there in the very first exchange. He talks about being locked in all week, cutting weight at heavyweight, how his training has evolved from the “30 minutes a day” days to serious two-session work, and why the current heavyweight title picture drama doesn’t interest him. Derrick also discusses whether an interim title could be next if the champion is sidelined, why the UFC will always chase the biggest ticket-seller, and how he turns into a completely different person on fight night—leading to the legendary post-fight moments that fans can’t forget. 🔒 Become a Member for special Perks, Exclusive Content and ultra-exclusive Live Chats: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrG2_1TcVkXKXXsD6Kjwig/join #bisping #ufc #mma #mixedmartialarts #michaelbisping #ufcnews #mmanews #ufc324 #derricklewis",

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. I put out a call for questions — and you delivered. In this episode, I sit down and answer fan questions spanning the full spectrum of MMA: training camps, old-school tournaments, Jon Jones, Gable Steveson, and how this sport actually works behind the scenes. We talk about why “camp” became a thing in MMA, what really matters in tournament fighting, and why some matchups make sense on paper — and some don’t. I also address questions about Jon Jones’ influence, Gable Steveson’s ceiling, and what separates dangerous fighters from proven draws. No hot takes for the sake of noise. Just honest answers, real context, and a few stories along the way.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Chael Sonnen makes a clear prediction: Paddy Pimblett is going to beat Justin Gaethje — and Chael explains why this conclusion has nothing to do with curses, hype, or disrespect. Chael walks through Justin Gaethje’s public stance heading into the fight, including the talk of “title shot or retirement,” and why that kind of language historically creates problems. Chael doesn’t accuse Gaethje of quitting — but he does question whether that mindset signals urgency or a fighter with one foot out the door. The discussion also touches on Gaethje’s recent arguments about belts, bonuses, and recognition, and why those points didn’t fully add up in Chael’s view — especially given that two of Gaethje’s last four fights were already for belts. Chael explains why talking about money, retirement, and past accomplishments is a dangerous place to live when the opponent is fully focused on what comes next. On the other side, Chael points out that Paddy Pimblett isn’t carrying any of that baggage. No talk of last runs. No negotiation posture. Just forward momentum and a clear target — which Chael believes matters more than people realize. Chael closes by explaining why mindset, timing, and focus — not resumes — are what swing this fight. Watch the full breakdown and let us know if you agree. #UFC #PaddyPimblett #JustinGaethje #ChaelSonnen #MMA #UFCPredictions Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Conor made multiple headline-level claims in a matter of days, including statements about his contract status and his future with the UFC. Historically, those moments dominate fight week. This time, they didn’t. Chael breaks down the unusual silence surrounding Conor on media day, why no one asked the expected questions, and why that absence matters more than any tweet. The discussion isn’t about rumors or predictions — it’s about leverage, timing, and how attention actually works during a UFC fight week. Using past examples, Chael explains how Conor has historically redirected the spotlight, why that tactic worked for years, and why this moment stands out as something new. Whether this shift is temporary or meaningful remains unclear — but the change itself is undeniable. If you follow UFC media cycles, fighter negotiations, or how fight week narratives are built, this is a rare look at what happens when the usual pattern breaks. Watch the full breakdown, and decide for yourself what this silence really means.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Chael Sonnen looks at the booking of Sean O’Malley vs. Song Yadong and admits something unusual: there has to be a reason — but nobody’s saying it out loud. Chael breaks down O’Malley’s own explanation for the matchup, including his clear roadmap toward another title run and the stakes he’s publicly put on himself. But when it comes to Song Yadong, the picture gets murkier. If Song wins, does he jump the line? Is this quietly a No. 1 contender fight? Or is it something else entirely? Chael also brings in broader context from the bantamweight division — including Merab Dvalishvili, Petr Yan, and the unanswered questions surrounding divisional hierarchy. One side is creating urgency. The other isn’t. And that matters. The result? A compelling fight with unclear consequences — and Chael isn’t convinced that’s an accident. Watch, then decide for yourself: is this a true title eliminator… or a matchup waiting for its meaning?

By calling it “title or bust,” Sean raised the stakes himself, and that decision reshapes how this matchup has to be viewed. In this breakdown, Chael looks at why O’Malley vs. Song Yadong feels confusing on paper, yet compelling in context. The talent level isn’t the issue. The question is what the fight represents. If Sean wins, the path forward is clear. If he doesn’t, the pressure he created complicates everything — not because the UFC said so, but because he did. Chael walks through the ripple effects across the bantamweight division, including where this leaves Merab Dvalishvili, Umar Nurmagomedov, and the ongoing title picture involving Petr Yan. With no straight-line bracket, pressure and perception suddenly matter as much as rankings. This isn’t about predicting retirement or manufacturing drama. It’s about understanding how fighters sometimes create stakes that force the promotion — and the audience — to look at a fight differently. That’s why this matchup matters. And that’s why the stakes feel real.

O’Malley opens up about the mental journey after back-to-back losses to Merab Dvalishvili, explains why 2025 was still one of the best years of his life, and talks about staying consistent in the gym without overreacting to defeat. He breaks down what makes Song dangerous, why MMA math doesn’t matter, and what he needs most on fight night: 15 minutes of focus, sharp footwork, and staying ready for anything. Sugar also discusses fatherhood, training, building the brand, opening a pickleball gym, and why a win sets up a clear path back to the title—potentially a shot at Petr Yan in 2026. 🔒 Become a Member for special Perks, Exclusive Content and ultra-exclusive Live Chats: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrG2_1TcVkXKXXsD6Kjwig/join #bisping #ufc #mma #mixedmartialarts #michaelbisping #ufcnews #mmanews #seanomalley #ufc324",

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. This is a tough one — and that’s why it’s interesting. Chael reacts to Michael Bisping breaking down Paddy Pimblett vs Justin Gaethje, and why the matchup isn’t as one-sided as people think. Bisping took some heat for his take, but if you listen closely, there’s real logic behind it — even if it sounds chaotic at first. Gaethje has more experience. He’s fought the very best. But when you look at how he’s lost — submissions, brief lapses, single moments — a pattern starts to emerge. Paddy doesn’t need to out-strike Justin. He doesn’t need to out-wrestle him. He just needs one transition, one scramble, one moment where creativity beats structure. Chael explains why Gaethje’s wrestling — even when unused offensively — still changes opponents’ behavior, and why Max Holloway showed the blueprint by ignoring a threat that rarely comes. At the same time, Paddy’s ability to create chaos in flurries, force odd positions, and hunt submissions late makes this fight dangerous in ways the odds don’t fully capture. This isn’t about winning every exchange. It’s about winning one exchange so completely that the other guy has to surrender. And if you’re thinking about the betting angle, that kind of outcome is exactly why my partners at DraftKings can make things interesting.

In this breakdown, Chael reacts to Don Davis stepping down from leadership at the Professional Fighters League, and why that moment exposes a much bigger issue than roster depth or rankings. The PFL wasn’t short on top-10 fighters — they were short on anticipation. Chael explains why simply matching ranked athletes against each other isn’t enough anymore, and how combat sports have shifted into an era where spectacle, narrative, and fan curiosity drive the business. Punches and kicks alone don’t sell tickets. Anticipation does. That’s where Jake Paul comes in. Jake had a PFL contract. Jake draws attention. Jake creates chaos, conversation, and curiosity — the exact ingredients a growing promotion needs. Yet somehow, the momentum died. No callouts. No appearances. No storyline. Just a contract that quietly expired. Chael also ties this into the broader fight landscape, including why the UFC still understands promotion better than anyone, and why big ideas that “don’t make sense on paper” often make perfect sense for fans. So now the real question isn’t what happened — it’s what happens next. If Jake Paul ever does MMA, where does he go?

Gaethje reflects on his record-breaking UFC bonus run, growing up in rural Arizona, fighting without emotion, and why he believes Paddy will make costly mistakes over five rounds. He addresses criticisms about his past submission losses, details the work he’s done since the Charles Oliveira fight, breaks down Pimblett’s footwork and confidence, and explains why this matchup excites him. Gaethje also discusses training under Trevor Wittman, fighting at altitude, potential future bouts with Max Holloway or Ilia Topuria, and why he plans to finish Pimblett late.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. When Donald Trump, Dana White, and Jake Paul are in the same room, people immediately jump to conclusions. Social media ran with the idea that this meeting meant a Jake Paul fight on a UFC card — even worse, a fight on the grounds of the White House. That’s not how this business works. In this video, I explain what that conversation wasn’t about — and more importantly, what it realistically could have been about. Jake Paul’s contract with the Professional Fighters League is over. Dana White is producing a historic UFC event tied to the White House setting. And Trump? He’s Trump — he talks to everyone. None of that automatically equals a fight booking. The UFC doesn’t book novelty matches. It doesn’t throw together “cool-sounding” fights with no rankings, no stakes, and no future. Every matchup has meaning, direction, and consequence. That’s why ideas like Jake Paul debuting on a White House card don’t survive even a basic reality check. This clip breaks down how these rumors start, why people believe them, and why the UFC’s brand has never operated that way — no matter how unusual the setting may be. A cage near the White House doesn’t change the rules, the rankings, or the standards. Before you believe the next viral MMA rumor, slow down and think it through.

According to DraftKings, Paddy Pimblett is a minus-230 favorite over Justin Gaethje. That’s not a pick’em. That’s confidence. Not a year ago. Not six months ago. But right now, the market believes Paddy Pimblett is the guy more likely to win — and that alone deserves a serious conversation. When Paddy first arrived in the UFC, the expectations were modest. Fun personality, strong regional draw, good for business. Even the UFC openly talked about a long-term development plan. Now we’re no longer talking about popularity or main events — we’re talking about world title implications and legitimate championship paths. Meanwhile, Justin Gaethje has done everything. Title fights. Five-round wars. Main events. Experience that normally commands respect from oddsmakers. Yet here he is, a sizable underdog. So the real question becomes how this fight is supposed to play out. Does Paddy need takedowns? A submission? Does he have to finish? Or has the game shifted enough that a decision is on the table? This clip doesn’t make a prediction. It asks the right questions — the same ones bettors are answering with their money. Watch, decide for yourself, and let me know if you see the fight the way the odds do. 👉 Subscribe for more fight analysis, betting perspective, and straight talk. #UFC #PaddyPimblett #JustinGaethje #UFCOdds #MMABetting #ChaelSonnen #DraftKings Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK Former UFC veteran Matt Brown raised an interesting point this week — and the more you look at it, the harder it is to ignore. The current main event featuring Paddy Pimblett and Justin Gaethje feels less like a true lightweight title fight and more like a co-main event filling space. That wasn’t supposed to be the plan. The original direction pointed toward Ilia Topuria versus Arman Tsarukyan — a clean, undisputed story at 155. But circumstances changed. Injuries, timing, and negotiations reshuffled the deck, and now the card feels like a watered-down version of what the division actually deserves. Here’s where it gets interesting: while others stayed quiet, Tsarukyan has been out front doing the media rounds, carrying the promotional load, and publicly calling out the lack of effort around him. That’s not accidental. That’s a fighter positioning himself as Plan B — the insurance policy when cards fall apart. Backup fighters matter. They train. They cut weight. They show up. And historically, almost every backup fighter ends up fighting for the belt — with one notable exception. Asking the same fighter to do it again without guarantees is where things get complicated. The UFC just lost its co-main event and its only undisputed title fight. In moments like that, you don’t need perfect answers — you need someone willing to say yes and protect the card. Right now, that someone appears to be Arman Tsarukyan. The only unanswered question: if Plan B saves the night, what does Plan B get in return? #UFC #PaddyPimblett #JustinGaethje #ArmanTsarukyan #IliaTopuria #MMA #FightAnalysis Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
