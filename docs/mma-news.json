      "description": "Get 15% OFF The House of Atlas Razor Kit + Before and After Set with the code CHAEL at https://www.houseofatlas.com/CHAEL! #houseofatlaspodBad Francis Ngannou just admitted he turned down a fight with Jake Paul — and wait until you hear why. According to Francis, MVP called him directly. They didn’t call to “talk business.” They called to offer him the fight. Only problem? Francis didn’t even realize that’s what was happening. So Jake Paul’s camp tries to make the fight. Francis says no. And now, everyone’s asking the same question — why? I’ll tell you what happened, why Francis got offended, and why this could go down as one of the strangest missed opportunities in combat sports history. Because at some point, turning down fights doesn’t make you a noble man… it makes you unemployed.

From real-life stories of boxers offering cash mid-fight to the recent scandals shaking up the NBA and MMA, Chael exposes how insider knowledge — even overheard in a coffee shop — can cross into federal crime territory. 👉 How much would you pay to win? 👉 What’s the true cost of “insider info”? 👉 And when does ambition become corruption?

      "description": "'WE'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE!' We just walked out of the Apex and… what a night. Daniel Cormier and I were still processing it in the car: one of the strangest eye-poke sequences we’ve ever seen—stoppage signaled, replay checked, then a restart that flipped the entire fight on its head. Yes, people will compare it to last week’s Tom Aspinall vs Ciryl Gane situation, but the circumstances were very different. Don’t lump them together. Waldo Cortes-Acosta fought through limited vision, came back furious after the restart, and closed the show—insane composure and power. Credit to the ref for using the replay signal decisively and getting it right under pressure. Main event? Steve Garcia looked sensational—educated pressure, slick head movement, cage cutting, and serious pop. David Onama is tough to finish, and Garcia still found the answer. He even tossed a callout up the ladder. Whether that’s next or not, keep that name circled. Elsewhere: tight decision battles, a slick submission, and an undefeated prospect causing Twitter to melt down with “fix” talk. I called the fight—didn’t look like that to me. Sometimes a new, well-rounded guy just arrives. I grabbed a late flight so I can wake up at home instead of waking up… rough. Quick debrief now, longer breakdown soon. Drop your thoughts below: Did the officials handle the eye-poke sequence perfectly?

This list includes everything from Yair Rodriguez vs Jeremy Stephens, Leon Edwards vs Belal Muhammad, Petr Yan vs Aljamain Sterling, Rousimar Palhares, and of course Jon Jones vs Matt Hamill — the only “loss” on Jones’ record. Along the way, Bisping shares behind-the-scenes stories, including being cageside in Mexico when chaos broke out and bottles started flying, and gives his take on why the fighters who get fouled are often the ones fans turn on. 👉 What do you think is the worst foul in UFC history?
