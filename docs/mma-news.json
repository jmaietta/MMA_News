On this edition, he and MMA Junkie reporter Danny Segura discuss the following: (00:00) - Intro (01:19) - We overestimated Reinier de Ridder, and his loss to Brendan Allen proved that he isn‚Äôt UFC champion material. (06:31) - UFC 321: Anything other than a dominant performance from Tom Aspinall would be disappointing. (11:13) - UFC 321: If Mackenzie Dern doesn‚Äôt win this vacant title, she‚Äôll officially be considered a bust. (15:58) - UFC 321: Nobody has more pressure to win than Umar Nurmagomedov. (21:45) - Khamzat Chimaev doesn't deserve to challenge Alex Pereira for the light heavyweight title. (24:28) - Sean Brady got screwed over by the UFC.
