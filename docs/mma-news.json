      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cB6w7gDb1o",
      "description": "Chael Sonnen breaks down one of the most fascinating redemption stories in MMA — the rise, fall, and rebirth of Mohammad Mokaev. Once a 14–0 phenom ranked top-3 in the world, Mokaev suddenly found himself off the main card, out of the UFC, and facing rumors that his contract — or reputation — had run out. But as Chael reveals, what happened next defines character. Mokaev didn’t complain, didn’t point fingers — he went to work. Competing in Brave CF, taking grappling matches, and showing he’s still one of the most skilled and disciplined fighters on the planet. Sonnen calls Mokaev’s journey a “case study” in how a fighter handles adversity the right way — with humility, consistency, and class. From owning past mistakes to earning another shot at the big stage, Chael believes Mokaev’s story isn’t finished — it’s just getting started. “If he makes it back,” Chael says, “the UFC won’t rebuild him — they’ll fast-track him.” This is more than a comeback story. It’s about accountability, growth, and the fighter’s code — something Chael Sonnen knows better than anyone. #MohammadMokaev #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMA #BraveCF #Redemption #UFCReturn #FighterMindset Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

In this clip, Chael breaks down what it really means to be a “prize fighter,” why calling TMZ isn’t the move, and why refusing a challenge in public says everything about a fighter’s mindset. Watch Chael unpack the psychology, the pride, and the money behind Ngannou’s decision — and why on Chael’s playground, there’s only one rule: you don’t back down. 👉 Comment below — was Francis right to pass, or should a real prize fighter always step up?",

Daniel Cormier gives his take on Jones' comments, and reveals EXACTLY WHY Jon is saying those things about Tom. DC says Jon isn't telling the whole truth because Tom is still technically his competition since Jones came back to the UFC and MMA from retirement.
