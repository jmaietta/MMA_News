Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. When Donald Trump, Dana White, and Jake Paul are in the same room, people immediately jump to conclusions. Social media ran with the idea that this meeting meant a Jake Paul fight on a UFC card — even worse, a fight on the grounds of the White House. That’s not how this business works. In this video, I explain what that conversation wasn’t about — and more importantly, what it realistically could have been about. Jake Paul’s contract with the Professional Fighters League is over. Dana White is producing a historic UFC event tied to the White House setting. And Trump? He’s Trump — he talks to everyone. None of that automatically equals a fight booking. The UFC doesn’t book novelty matches. It doesn’t throw together “cool-sounding” fights with no rankings, no stakes, and no future. Every matchup has meaning, direction, and consequence. That’s why ideas like Jake Paul debuting on a White House card don’t survive even a basic reality check. This clip breaks down how these rumors start, why people believe them, and why the UFC’s brand has never operated that way — no matter how unusual the setting may be. A cage near the White House doesn’t change the rules, the rankings, or the standards. Before you believe the next viral MMA rumor, slow down and think it through.

According to DraftKings, Paddy Pimblett is a minus-230 favorite over Justin Gaethje. That’s not a pick’em. That’s confidence. Not a year ago. Not six months ago. But right now, the market believes Paddy Pimblett is the guy more likely to win — and that alone deserves a serious conversation. When Paddy first arrived in the UFC, the expectations were modest. Fun personality, strong regional draw, good for business. Even the UFC openly talked about a long-term development plan. Now we’re no longer talking about popularity or main events — we’re talking about world title implications and legitimate championship paths. Meanwhile, Justin Gaethje has done everything. Title fights. Five-round wars. Main events. Experience that normally commands respect from oddsmakers. Yet here he is, a sizable underdog. So the real question becomes how this fight is supposed to play out. Does Paddy need takedowns? A submission? Does he have to finish? Or has the game shifted enough that a decision is on the table? This clip doesn’t make a prediction. It asks the right questions — the same ones bettors are answering with their money. Watch, decide for yourself, and let me know if you see the fight the way the odds do. 👉 Subscribe for more fight analysis, betting perspective, and straight talk. #UFC #PaddyPimblett #JustinGaethje #UFCOdds #MMABetting #ChaelSonnen #DraftKings Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

From the very first interim title with Randy Couture and Chuck Liddell, to legendary bouts like McGregor vs Mendes, Whittaker vs Romero, Ferguson vs Gaethje, and Adesanya vs Gastelum, The Count explains how chaos, injuries, suspensions, and controversy create moments like this. With the undisputed champion unavailable once again, will Paddy become the newest interim champ, or can Gaethje make history as a two-time interim title holder? 🔒 Become a Member for special Perks, Exclusive Content and ultra-exclusive Live Chats: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrG2_1TcVkXKXXsD6Kjwig/join #bisping #ufc #mma #mixedmartialarts #MichaelBisping #UFC324 #PaddyPimblett #JustinGaethje #ConorMcGregor #ChadMendes #IsraelAdesanya #KelvinGastelum #RobertWhittaker #YoelRomero #TonyFerguson #DustinPoirier #MaxHolloway #RandyCouture #ChuckLiddell #TitoOrtiz",

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK Former UFC veteran Matt Brown raised an interesting point this week — and the more you look at it, the harder it is to ignore. The current main event featuring Paddy Pimblett and Justin Gaethje feels less like a true lightweight title fight and more like a co-main event filling space. That wasn’t supposed to be the plan. The original direction pointed toward Ilia Topuria versus Arman Tsarukyan — a clean, undisputed story at 155. But circumstances changed. Injuries, timing, and negotiations reshuffled the deck, and now the card feels like a watered-down version of what the division actually deserves. Here’s where it gets interesting: while others stayed quiet, Tsarukyan has been out front doing the media rounds, carrying the promotional load, and publicly calling out the lack of effort around him. That’s not accidental. That’s a fighter positioning himself as Plan B — the insurance policy when cards fall apart. Backup fighters matter. They train. They cut weight. They show up. And historically, almost every backup fighter ends up fighting for the belt — with one notable exception. Asking the same fighter to do it again without guarantees is where things get complicated. The UFC just lost its co-main event and its only undisputed title fight. In moments like that, you don’t need perfect answers — you need someone willing to say yes and protect the card. Right now, that someone appears to be Arman Tsarukyan. The only unanswered question: if Plan B saves the night, what does Plan B get in return? #UFC #PaddyPimblett #JustinGaethje #ArmanTsarukyan #IliaTopuria #MMA #FightAnalysis Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Conor McGregor doesn’t lose often — but this time, he did. And it wasn’t in the Octagon. When Dana White was asked about booking Conor McGregor vs. Michael Chandler for the White House card, his answer stunned everyone: he wasn’t interested. That response landed at the same time Conor tweeted that he’d fight “anybody” put in front of him — a tough message, sure, but also a revealing one. In this breakdown, Chael explains why that tweet wasn’t strength — it was exposure. It sounded like a competitor ready to go, but not like a man in control of his own career. That’s not the “red panty night” Conor. That’s not the version who picked opponents, dictated terms, and bent the sport around him. The biggest stars in combat sports — Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, Jon Jones, Alex Pereira, even Tom Aspinall — don’t speak like that when they’re in charge. This clip explains why that single tweet changed the perception of Conor McGregor — and why it may signal something bigger happening behind the scenes.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK How would Gable Steveson actually do in the UFC? That’s the question everyone keeps circling without answering. There’s a viral clip of Gable wrestling with Jon Jones, and it’s impressive — athletic, explosive, high-level movement. But clips don’t build UFC careers. Fights do. This breakdown looks at what it really takes for a heavyweight to reach the UFC and why Gable’s situation is unusual. Normally, you beat everyone on the regional scene, target the biggest threat available, and force the promotion’s hand. Gable appears willing to compete — wrestling, jiu-jitsu, MMA, even bare-knuckle — but willingness alone doesn’t create momentum. Here’s where it gets interesting. If Gable truly has championship potential, he doesn’t need a slow build. He needs a lightning rod. And there is one available: Francis Ngannou. Ngannou has publicly stated his contract situation is open. He’s looking for fights. He’s made noise about big stages and big events. Offering him Gable forces a response. Acceptance creates instant credibility for Gable. Refusal creates headlines — and pressure. There’s also a narrative layer that’s impossible to ignore. Jon Jones and Ngannou never settled their business. Now Jones has a protégé. Ngannou has unfinished words. Sometimes the disciple does the fighting where the mentor no longer can. Whether the fight happens or not almost doesn’t matter. The conversation does. If Gable Steveson is the future, this is how you find out. #GableSteveson #JonJones #FrancisNgannou #UFC #MMA #Heavyweight #FightAnalysis Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. The UFC lightweight title picture has reached an uncomfortable place — and it centers on Arman Tsarukyan. There is no real controversy surrounding Tsarukyan’s talent or résumé. The issue is logistical. The division keeps moving, title fights are being scheduled, and yet no clear path has been defined for a contender who appears impossible to deny. Pretending frustration or delaying decisions only works for so long. At the same time, Ilia Topuria has handled his situation with transparency. When weight cuts or personal circumstances made defending unrealistic, he publicly encouraged the UFC to move forward rather than holding up the division. That approach led to interim solutions — but history has shown that interim titles don’t always guarantee the next shot. With Paddy Pimblett set to face Justin Gaethje, the assumption is that the winner eventually draws into Topuria. The timing matters. If Topuria returns within a reasonable window, Tsarukyan can be positioned as a backup, a co-main, or a next-in-line contender. If that window stretches, the conversation changes entirely. There is also the broader implication. Vacating titles, interim championships, and contender placement have precedent — and none of them exist to punish fighters. They exist to keep divisions functional. The reality is simple: nobody is angry at Arman Tsarukyan. The division just hasn’t figured out how to deal with him yet. 👉 Subscribe for more UFC analysis, title-picture breakdowns, and fight-business context. #UFC #ArmanTsarukyan #IliaTopuria #LightweightDivision #MMANews #FightBusiness #ChaelSonnen #UFCTitles Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. The Conor McGregor situation continues to raise questions — and the timeline no longer makes sense. For months, the direction appeared clear. Conor McGregor was expected to return against Michael Chandler, potentially on the White House card. That plan was publicly supported by McGregor, Chandler, and Dana White, seemingly checking every box required to make the fight happen. Then everything shifted. McGregor was suddenly unable to be booked due to a suspension. Shortly after, White stated there was no interest in booking the fight. Soon after that, McGregor introduced an entirely new explanation — claiming that the UFC’s Paramount distribution deal voided his contract. That claim is highly unusual. Broadcast and streaming deals have changed repeatedly throughout UFC history, from pay-per-view to FOX, ESPN, and now Paramount. Those changes have never altered fighter contracts, and no other athlete has suggested otherwise. Which raises a far more important question: why introduce this explanation now? This breakdown explores the inconsistencies in the timeline, the realities of UFC contract enforcement, and why this explanation feels less like a cause — and more like an offramp. The full story may not be public yet. But history suggests the answer usually surfaces later, quietly, through administrative channels.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Speculation surrounding the UFC’s rumored White House card has taken a strange turn — and much of it ignores how the organization actually operates. With reports linking names like Jorge Masvidal to a possible return and wild theories ranging from retired fighters to novelty matchups, a narrative has formed suggesting the White House card will be chaotic, unusual, or built on spectacle rather than substance. That assumption doesn’t align with UFC history. Major UFC events have always followed the same pattern. UFC 100, UFC 200, UFC 300, Madison Square Garden, and the Sphere debut all carried massive expectations — and all delivered elite championship-level fights. None relied on gimmicks. None abandoned contenders. None sacrificed sporting legitimacy for shock value. This breakdown challenges the idea that a landmark venue requires a “weird” card. The UFC is built on roster depth, flexibility, and championship relevance. Replacement fights have often outperformed original plans, while promotions that leaned on novelty and retired stars historically struggled to survive. The analysis also addresses why assumptions about suspended fighters, contract disputes, or long-retired names being rushed into a White House showcase don’t fit the UFC’s proven business model. The organization has never needed spectacle to sell historic events — it has relied on champions and future champions. The takeaway is simple: history matters. And history suggests the White House card, if it happens, will look exactly like every other massive UFC moment — elite, serious, and championship-driven. 👉 Subscribe for more UFC analysis, fight-business insight, and industry context. #UFC #WhiteHouseCard #JorgeMasvidal #DanaWhite #MMANews #FightBusiness #ChaelSonnen #UFCHistory Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. The Iowa vs Penn State dual meet had everything — a sold-out Carver‑Hawkeye Arena, national attention, overtime matches, one-point decisions, and elite talent on both sides. On paper, it looked razor-close. On the scoreboard, it was a blowout. And that contrast tells the real story. Penn State won the moments that mattered. Match after match was decided late, often in the third period, and every close call fell the same way. That isn’t randomness — that’s a program that understands when to win. One standout performance came from Rocco Welsh, who showed why he’s more than an NCAA contender. His ceiling extends beyond college wrestling, and performances like this reinforce why his long-term goals are Olympic-level, not just national titles. But the most important takeaway centers on Nasir Bailey. The tools are already there. The conditioning is there. The skill set is there. What this match revealed is the difference between wrestling hard — and wrestling to win when it counts. History offers examples of athletes who didn’t always dominate conferences but peaked when championships were on the line. The lesson is simple but unforgiving: knowing when to win matters as much as knowing how to wrestle. This breakdown explains why Penn State keeps separating itself, why close matches don’t always mean close outcomes, and why Bailey remains a legitimate NCAA title threat.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Conor McGregor has made a very unusual claim — that the UFC’s new Paramount distribution deal somehow voids his contract. It’s a claim that immediately raises questions, not because of legality, but because of motive. Broadcast and distribution deals have never been the athlete’s business. The UFC has moved from pay-per-view to FOX, then ESPN, and now Paramount. None of those changes altered fighter contracts, and none of the more than 700 athletes currently under contract believe this affects them — including Conor himself. So why say it? Chael Sonnen breaks down why this claim doesn’t hold up, how fighter contracts actually work, and why there are already multiple legitimate ways for a fighter to step away without inventing a new legal theory. This isn’t about whether Conor can fight elsewhere — fighters have always had paths out. This is about why this specific argument is being used, and why it’s being used now. The timing matters. This comes on the heels of McGregor vs. Chandler falling apart, a suspension nearing its end, a healed leg, and public statements about returning. When the usual explanations run out, a new narrative has to be built. This video explores the psychology of fighting, the reality of contract leverage in MMA, and the difference between not being able to fight and simply not wanting to fight anymore — a reality many fighters struggle to admit, not out of fear, but because fighting has been their identity for so long. There’s no accusation here. Wanting to step away doesn’t make anyone weak or dishonest. But claiming a broadcast deal voids a contract? That’s a strange road to take — and it deserves to be examined.

      "description": "Credit where it’s due — MMA Mania put out seven prop bets for the rumored White House card, and it sparked a conversation worth having. Because somewhere along the way, this event turned into a two-headed monster. The White House card has completely dominated the media cycle — to the point where it’s overshadowing a network debut on Paramount+, a legitimate world championship fight, and an otherwise normal UFC schedule. And that’s where things start to drift into fantasy. People are acting like the UFC is going to rewrite every rule, every structure, and every precedent for one night. That’s not how this sport works. Let’s be clear: the UFC doesn’t design interim titles in advance. They don’t plan chaos. Interim belts happen when cards fall apart — not because someone wants extra shine. Main events are still five rounds. Title fights still headline. Rankings still matter. And no, Conor McGregor is not suddenly being dropped into a meaningless fight at a random weight just to say he was there. McGregor vs Michael Chandler only works because of history. Remove Chandler, and the fight stops meaning anything. That’s why inserting another name doesn’t solve the problem — it creates one. As for presidential appearances, speeches, or gimmicks? Expect the same restraint the UFC always shows. The organization dances with the one that brought it. The White House card will be big. It will be important. But it will still be the UFC — not a brand-new product invented overnight. That’s the reality, whether the prop bets like it or not. #UFC #WhiteHouseCard #MMAMania #FightNews #MMA #CombatSports #UFCAnalysis Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Chael don’t criticize Conor McGregor very often — because usually, he gets it right. But this time? This one was a miss. Conor has only ever sold one thing in his entire MMA career that wasn’t fully real: the idea that he holds power inside the UFC. Not influence. Not star value. Actual decision-making power. And to his credit, he sold that perception better than anyone in the history of the sport. That’s why this moment matters. After Dana White publicly stated he’s no longer interested in booking McGregor vs Michael Chandler — period — Conor responded with a tweet saying he’d fight anyone put in front of him. It sounds tough. It sounds honorable. But it’s also the response of a fighter who just learned about his own career at the same time the rest of us did. That’s not leverage. That’s not power. That’s an open tryout mindset — the attitude of every hungry contender trying to get a call, not the sport’s biggest draw. Muhammad Ali never said it. Mike Tyson never said it. Neither have Jon Jones, Alex Pereira, or Tom Aspinall. Conor is still the needle-mover. Red panty night is still real. But this response blurred the line between the star and everyone else. Sometimes the smartest move is silence. This time, saying nothing would’ve said everything. #ConorMcGregor #DanaWhite #MichaelChandler #UFC #MMA #FightNews #CombatSports Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Jon Jones vs. Alex Pereira at heavyweight… at the White House? Chael Sonnen says the more you think about it, the less sense it makes. After Joe Rogan called it “the biggest fight in the history of humanity,” Chael steps back and breaks down the logistical nightmare behind the hype. No belt on the line means no guaranteed five rounds. No belt also means it likely can’t headline — and you’re not putting Jon Jones and Alex Pereira on a card anywhere as anything but the main event. So what’s the solution? Chael presents the only scenario that fixes everything at once: make it a title fight for Pereira’s light heavyweight belt. That gives you five rounds. That gives you legitimacy. That gives you a true main event worthy of the spectacle people are trying to build. But there’s one catch — Jon Jones has to come home. Back to 205 pounds. Back to light heavyweight. Back to the division he once ruled. This isn’t fantasy matchmaking — it’s Chael applying fight business logic to one of the wildest proposed events in UFC history. If Jones vs. Pereira is really happening, this is the only way it works. #JonJones #AlexPereira #UFC #MMA #JoeRogan #ChaelSonnen #LightHeavyweight",

      "description": "Hey guys—do Chael a favor: ask Jon Jones on social media if he’ll go back to 205 pounds to fight Alex Pereira. Because if we’re serious about making Jones vs Pereira a real mega-fight, the cleanest solution is right there. At heavyweight, the fight loses the one thing that makes fights matter: a belt. At 205? You can fight for Pereira’s title, you get five rounds, you get a main event, and you don’t have to invent rules on the spot. And that’s exactly the lane Dana White recently left open—Pereira vs Jones, but at light heavyweight. Here’s the part people keep skipping: moving to heavyweight “to chase greatness” is about championships. And going through Jon Jones at heavyweight is the worst possible path to that goal. Fight him at 205 first—then go up. Win or lose, you’ve at least handled the Jon Jones problem without sacrificing the rest of the plan. And let’s fix the record while we’re here: Pereira didn’t go to 205 because he “cleaned out” 185—he moved up after losing the middleweight belt, debuted at light heavyweight against Jan Błachowicz, and built from there. So the question is simple: Will Jon Jones actually do 205 for Pereira? If he’s replying on social, let’s find out. #JonJones #AlexPereira #UFC #MMA #LightHeavyweight #Heavyweight #FightNews Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
