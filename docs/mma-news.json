      "title": "Why Chael's Picking Joshua Van for Fighter of the Year",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxVGpb6G6nE",
      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL! #bruntpoChael Fighter of the Year isn’t a statistic. It’s an argument and Chael Sonnen isn’t afraid to make it. In this clip, Chael breaks down why he believes Joshua Van deserves serious consideration in the Fighter of the Year conversation — even while others point to Merab Dvalishvili’s year of title fights as the obvious pick. This isn’t a takedown of anyone. It’s a challenge to the way fans think about greatness. Chael compares championship moments, calendar-year performance, and consistency — explaining why “perfect” isn’t required to be dominant. Drawing from past debates and controversial picks, he shows how momentum, difficulty of opposition, and big moments matter just as much as undefeated records. The conversation also turns toward today’s hot topic: rematches. Chael explains why one future fight could completely change how the past is remembered — and why fans should be careful about rushing to judgment when careers are still being written. Whether you agree or disagree, this breakdown makes one thing clear: this isn’t about popularity. It’s about performance. If you love real fight debate, not clickbait, not hype but hard opinions backed by logic, this one is for you.

Was the victory over Merab Dvalishvili more about Yan’s stellar performance or the former champion biting off more than he can chew with his 4th fight in a calendar year? Does ’The Machine’ warrant an immediate rematch or should the UFC turn to a different opponent for Petr Yan? In the flyweight co main event, Alexandre Pantoja lost his title to Joshua Van due to an arm injury… how do the guy think Van should feel about winning his first championship in this fashion? Much like the main event, is an immediate rematch in store at flyweight? And, Triple C officially hangs up the gloves following his loss this past weekend… DC & Chael dive into what his legacy is to the sport. ✔️ Subscribe to ESPN Unlimited: https://plus.espn.com/ #ESPN",

      "description": "Bare-knuckle wrestling is intense, but Chael Sonnen argues that blaming the gloves is a massive copout. In this clip, he explains why fighters must be held accountable for actions like eye pokes, grabbing the fence, or kicking opponents while down — regardless of whether gloves are involved. Chael points out that referees and fans often label these incidents “unintentional,” but that mindset ignores responsibility. Even without gloves, fighters can and should avoid fouls. The real issue isn’t the equipment — it’s accountability. If someone pokes an opponent in the eye, someone is at fault, plain and simple. This clip is essential for anyone following MMA rules, bare-knuckle combat, or fighter safety. Chael’s analysis highlights how leniency for “accidents” undermines fairness, sets poor precedents, and affects how fights are judged. He stresses that proper enforcement and accountability maintain the integrity of the sport, rather than blaming gloves or equipment. For fans of MMA, bare-knuckle fighting, fighter safety, and insider fight analysis, this breakdown delivers Chael Sonnen’s sharp and unfiltered perspective.",

In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains why the odds made no sense, why Petr Yan was being dismissed far too easily, and why Merab Dvalishvili was walking into something much more dangerous than he expected. This wasn’t a wrestling match. This wasn’t a kickboxing match. This was mixed martial arts — and Yan fought it that way. Chael walks through what mattered: defensive underhooks, walking Merab down, the discipline of jabs and crosses, the lack of wasted motion, and the threat of wrestling that made every punch more dangerous. Yan didn’t throw everything. He committed to what worked. The conversation also breaks down the myth of “better striker vs better wrestler” and why that thinking gets fighters beat at the highest level. When championship fights happen, we don’t find out who’s the better grappler or striker — we find out who’s the better mixed martial artist. Merab fought like a champion. But Petr Yan fought like the man who had the answer. This wasn’t chaos. This was control. Only one kind of fighting wins at the top level… and Petr Yan just demonstrated it.

In this clip, Chael Sonnen breaks down how the UFC could handle one of the most explosive young talents in MMA. Rogan even clipped Steveson’s last fight and sent it directly to Dana White — a signal that this is a fighter you don’t ignore. Chael lays out the dilemma: Contender Series signings are one thing, but how do you introduce a fighter of Steveson’s caliber without wasting his talent or throwing him into an undercard he doesn’t belong on? Chael suggests a strategic approach: pay Steveson his worth, build him carefully, and consider a high-profile fight in another promotion like the PFL to gauge his readiness against elite opponents such as Francis Ngannou. If he wins, you’ve got a star ready for the big stage; if he doesn’t, you have your answer without risking your top talent. This clip is a must-watch for fans of Gable Steveson, Contender Series prospects, and UFC matchmaking strategies. Chael’s insights show the balance between building a fighter’s career, protecting the UFC’s investment, and keeping fans hyped.",

This was about showing up when you already know it’s over. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains why Henry Cejudo’s final fight mattered more than any belt he ever wore. When a fighter steps into the cage knowing there’s no return, something changes. Every shot hurts more. Every exchange costs more. And the only question left is simple: How bad do you want it? Chael walks through what happens psychologically when an athlete knows this is truly their last night — why most fighters freeze, why some collapse, and why very few rise. With a busted nose, a swollen eye, and the score slipping away, Henry never checked out. He leaned in. Then comes the bigger truth. The day of the pure wrestler is gone. This breakdown also exposes how the sport itself has evolved — from specialists to complete fighters. Wrestling alone no longer wins championships. Striking alone doesn’t either. The new era demands everything, all at once… and shows no mercy. Henry Cejudo didn’t quit. The sport simply moved forward. And this night proved it.

Was it the fight people expected? No. Was it clean? No. Was it the ending some fans wanted? Also no. But when the referee stepped in and raised a hand, Joshua Van stood as world champion. Chael walks through the pressure of that moment: standing in front of a live crowd, hearing reactions you didn’t choose, wearing a belt you didn’t imagine receiving this way — and handling it like a professional anyway. No celebration choreography. No victory script. Just procedure, spotlight, and judgment. This is not a conversation about being “better.” It’s a conversation about winning. Chael also addresses the push for rematches, the injury discussion, and the anger from people trying to rewrite the outcome. History doesn’t care how you win. It only records that you did. If you love fight analysis that cuts through emotions, excuses, and fantasy outcomes — this one matters. Only one thing matters in MMA. Joshua Van proved it.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/HfIXp3Bg4sg",
      "description": "A UFC leak may have just confirmed a huge fight: Charles Oliveira versus Max Holloway for the BMF belt. Chael Sonnen breaks down what this leak means, why it matters, and how the UFC handles announcements when fighters speak first. According to Chael, the official UFC Brazil account briefly posted the news before deleting it — classic UFC style when they don’t control the narrative. Oliveira reportedly said he’s planning a match with Holloway for the BMF title, but didn’t give a date. He also mentioned he’s just a few fights away from being back in contention for a standard UFC title, meaning two or three wins could put him in prime position. Chael explains why Oliveira’s path makes sense: if he beats Holloway, he walks away with a belt and boosts his momentum in the lightweight division. This clip highlights the intersection of UFC politics, fighter ambition, and timing — and why leaks like this excite fans, shake up rankings, and keep the BMF conversation alive. If you’re following Charles Oliveira, Max Holloway, the BMF belt, or UFC lightweight title implications, this is a must-watch breakdown from Chael Sonnen.

      "description": "Arman Tsarukyan is making waves in the UFC, and Chael Sonnen is here to break down why his latest move matters. Fans have debated whether Tsarukyan got screwed out of a number one contender spot, but the situation is more nuanced than it appears. According to Chael, being “number one” doesn’t automatically lock in a title fight — it just means your next opportunity could be for the belt. What makes this moment exciting is Tsarukyan speaking up for himself. Instead of passively waiting, he’s now aiming high: he wants the BMF belt, and he’s willing to challenge Max Holloway for it. Chael explains why this is a smart, bold play — not only does it raise Tsarukyan’s profile, it also forces the UFC and fans to take notice of his intentions and skill. This clip highlights fighter strategy, divisional politics, and how a contender can leverage opportunities for maximum impact. Tsarukyan isn’t just sitting on a “golden ticket,” he’s actively shaping his path and making sure he gets the fights that matter. If you’re following Arman Tsarukyan, Max Holloway, UFC lightweight and featherweight dynamics, or want Chael’s sharp breakdowns of contender politics, this is a must-watch clip.

      "description": "Tom Aspinall didn’t fake anything — and Chael Sonnen is here to set the record straight. In this video, Chael asks a simple question: do some fans owe Tom Aspinall an apology? Because the heavyweight champ wasn’t just shaken up… he was legitimately hurt, and the situation could have cost him his belt over one wrong word. Chael breaks down the moment that sparked all the controversy: three eye pokes in under three minutes. That’s nearly one-third of the available fingers finding their way directly into Tom’s eye. Fans love to act like real fighters “would have continued,” but Chael explains why that mindset ignores the rules entirely. If Tom was hurt — and he clearly was — why wasn’t it a disqualification? Why do we always rush to call it “accidental” instead of acknowledging how egregious it actually was? This clip digs into fighter safety, the difference between accidental and reckless fouls, and the razor-thin line Tom walked as a champion. One wrong phrase to the referee and he could have lost his belt in a no-contest or forced stoppage. If you care about fairness, fighter protection, and the truth behind what really happened in the Octagon, this is essential Chael Sonnen analysis.

      "description": "Ilia Topuria and Islam Makhachev finally had a real reason to fight—yet somehow, the matchup has drifted even further apart. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains how Ilia managed to lose his ranking without ever losing a fight, and why that shift changes everything. Chael lays out the situation clearly: Ilia didn’t get beat, didn’t take damage, didn’t even stumble… yet he slips in the rankings and suddenly Islam has new directions to go. Instead of the long-hyped Ilia vs Islam showdown, the division now has fresh contenders. Islam Makhachev could be staring at a matchup with Kamaru Usman, a stylistic puzzle we’re not convinced Islam can solve. Meanwhile, Ilia Topuria may be heading toward Arman Tsarukyan, and fans aren’t confident Ilia gets over on a surging, dangerous Arman, either. The result? The fight everyone’s been circling for months has lost steam, lost urgency, and—according to Chael—lost its intrigue. The motivations are gone, the rankings have shifted, and both men now have bigger problems directly in front of them. If you’re following the chaos at lightweight and featherweight, or you want Chael’s unfiltered view on Islam Makhachev, Ilia Topuria, Kamaru Usman, and Arman Tsarukyan, this is the clip to watch.

      "description": "When you call out Jake Paul, timing matters—and this fighter picked the worst possible moment. Chael Sonnen breaks down why this move doesn’t just miss the mark… it actively damages the guy’s brand. In this clip, Chael reacts to a fighter openly flirting with a boxing match against Jake Paul while Jake is on the verge of facing Anthony Joshua. Instead of building momentum, he undercuts himself by suggesting the matchup would be “interesting” or “competitive” right before Jake steps into the biggest risk of his career. Chael lays out exactly why this is a disastrous strategy: you’re calling out a guy you can’t secure a contract with, who might get stopped by Joshua, and you’ve already told the public he’s on your level. The moment Jake loses, you lose your selling point. This is classic Chael—sharp, analytical, and brutally honest. He explains how timing, optics, and public perception make or break a potential boxing crossover. If you want a fight with a star, you don’t attach yourself to them right before a likely loss. You wait, position yourself, and elevate your own value. If you enjoy straight-talk breakdowns on Jake Paul, Anthony Joshua, boxing politics, and combat-sports marketing, this clip delivers.

Ends 1/4/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Chael Sonnen breaks down one of MMA’s most misunderstood topics: weight cutting. But he doesn’t just skim the surface — he calls out the myths, the medical “experts,” and the endless pretend conversations that ignore the only data that actually matters. From NCAA rule changes to the psychology of cutting, Chael explains why fighters and wrestlers are the healthiest athletes in the world… and why most fans and officials still get this issue completely wrong. Then Chael pivots to another long-running debate in the sport: eye pokes. Are they accidental? Are they avoidable? Or have we all just agreed to pretend something else is happening? Chael lays out the truth as only he can, comparing MMA to wrestling, judo, and bare knuckle while arguing that accountability — not gloves, rules committees, or redesigns — is the only real fix. If you care about fighter safety, rule enforcement, or the evolution of the sport, this is classic Chael: sharp, honest, and impossible to ignore. #ChaelSonnen #UFCRules #WeightCutting #EyePokes #MMA #MixedMartialArts #UCFFighters #CombatSports Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Ends 1/4/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Damon Martin just dropped a take so wild that Chael Sonnen had to stop, rewind, and ask the world one simple question: What are we even talking about here? In this clip, Chael breaks down why calling potential “massive superfights” for Merab Dvalishvili at featherweight isn’t just wrong — it’s fundamentally illogical. Chael walks through the entire argument step-by-step, comparing divisions, drawing parallels to real-world logic, and highlighting why a champion at 135 should, in theory, have the biggest opportunities in his own weight class. Yet Damon’s headline suggests the opposite: that somehow a non-drawing champion at 145 — a fighter not headlining or even co-headlining — is supposed to create a bigger fight for Merab than anyone in his own division. Chael isn’t buying it, and he’s asking Damon to “show his work.” This segment dives into business realities, star power, PPV placement, and the simple math of what actually makes a fight big. If you want a masterclass in MMA logic, this is Chael at his sharpest — funny, irritated, and surgical.

Ends 1/4/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. DraftKings just released the official betting odds for Merab Dvalishvili vs Petr Yan — and Chael says the numbers completely shocked him. Is Merab really a -425 favorite? Is Yan really a +330 underdog after stuffing 44 takedowns in their first fight? Chael breaks down the perception around the matchup, why fans think it was “rushed,” and the truth behind their first five-round war that most people forgot was even a rematch. He also explains the single adjustment Yan needs to finally flip the script — and why DraftKings may have just taken the pressure off of him entirely. If you love technical breakdowns, UFC history lessons, and Chael’s no-nonsense logic… this is one you don’t want to miss. #UFC #MerabDvalishvili #PetrYan #ChaelSonnen #UFCOdds #DraftKings #UFC323 Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
