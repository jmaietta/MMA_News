      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQY31mL4HAc",
      "description": "On this episode of Good Guy / Bad Guy…Back-to-back weekends of main event eye pokes and this time Tom Aspinall’s teammate was the culprit! Ante Delija is all the talk after he poked Waldo Cortes-Acosta in the eye and then immediately got knocked out after Cortes-Acosta decided to continue! Then, there’s a betting scandal in the UFC and DC had a front row seat to witness all the action. Hear what he says really happened when Isaac Dulgarian got submitted in the very first round. And, ESPN’s MMA Betting Guy Ian Parker joins the show to break down all the ins and outs of how the betting fallout went down! Plus, who has the greatest potential to be the next American born UFC Champion? “Gable Steveson!” Find out which of the guys is making that statement. Finally, Islam Makhachev is less than two weeks away from fighting for the Welterweight title at UFC 322 and his new use of creatine is making headlines! You do NOT want to miss what the Good Guy and Bad Guy are saying about it all! #espn #mma #ufc ✔ For more UFC, sign up for ESPN+ http://espnplus.com/ufc/youtube ✔ Get the ESPN App: http://www.espn.com/espn/apps/espn ✔ Subscribe to ESPN on YouTube: http://es.pn/SUBSCRIBEtoYOUTUBE ✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC ✔ Subscribe to NBA on ESPN on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoNBAonESPN ✔ Watch ESPN on YouTube TV: http://es.pn/YouTubeTV",

      "description": "'WE'VE NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE!' We just walked out of the Apex and… what a night. Daniel Cormier and I were still processing it in the car: one of the strangest eye-poke sequences we’ve ever seen—stoppage signaled, replay checked, then a restart that flipped the entire fight on its head. Yes, people will compare it to last week’s Tom Aspinall vs Ciryl Gane situation, but the circumstances were very different. Don’t lump them together. Waldo Cortes-Acosta fought through limited vision, came back furious after the restart, and closed the show—insane composure and power. Credit to the ref for using the replay signal decisively and getting it right under pressure. Main event? Steve Garcia looked sensational—educated pressure, slick head movement, cage cutting, and serious pop. David Onama is tough to finish, and Garcia still found the answer. He even tossed a callout up the ladder. Whether that’s next or not, keep that name circled. Elsewhere: tight decision battles, a slick submission, and an undefeated prospect causing Twitter to melt down with “fix” talk. I called the fight—didn’t look like that to me. Sometimes a new, well-rounded guy just arrives. I grabbed a late flight so I can wake up at home instead of waking up… rough. Quick debrief now, longer breakdown soon. Drop your thoughts below: Did the officials handle the eye-poke sequence perfectly?

Along the way, Bisping shares behind-the-scenes stories, including being cageside in Mexico when chaos broke out and bottles started flying, and gives his take on why the fighters who get fouled are often the ones fans turn on. 👉 What do you think is the worst foul in UFC history?
