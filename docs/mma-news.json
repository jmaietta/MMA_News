DC gives his take on the main event of the night, and his take on what's next for both Anthony Joshua and Jake Paul. Plus, Cormier discusses if this means the end of Paul in the ring, or if this is proof he can continue to make a career out of boxing professionally. DC also gives his flowers to Jake for lasting as long as he did in the fight. All lines provided by @hardrockbet Follow me on all social media platforms!

      "title": "Should Ilia Topuria Be Stripped? Chael Breaks It Down",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm49p6hQPfc",
      "description": "Should Ilia Topuria be stripped of the UFC lightweight title? Chael Sonnen doesn’t want that — but he also doesn’t know how the UFC avoids it. After a clip from The MMA Hour set off a firestorm, Chael clarifies what people missed: this isn’t about being “against Ilia.” It’s about how the fight business actually runs — precedent over feelings. Chael argues the UFC has an ethical problem either way. If you strip Ilia, you risk crowning a champion the promotion doesn’t truly believe is “the guy.” But if the champion isn’t defending — and it’s not clearly injury or illness — the entire structure of title fights starts to collapse. That’s where the interim belt is supposed to live: the “in-between.” Chael compares this situation to past champions who stepped away and the UFC moved on. The question becomes brutally simple: if nothing changes, and eventually you’d have to take the belt anyway… what’s the justification for waiting? Chael doesn’t claim this is open-and-shut. He wants the audience to make the best argument against stripping Ilia — and to explain why the rules should bend here. Watch, weigh in, and tell Chael what he’s missing. #IliaTopuria #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMA #UFCNews #Lightweight #InterimTitle #MMADebate #ArielHelwani Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Anthony Joshua vs Jake Paul might be the most talked-about fight in boxing — but it’s also one of the biggest sporting mismatches of our lifetime. The betting odds don’t fully reflect the massive gap in skill, experience, and power, and there’s a reason for that. Some fans believe this fight is scripted or “entertainment,” similar to pro wrestling. That belief — not confidence in Jake Paul’s boxing — is why the odds aren’t historically wide. The reality? This is not a work, not a setup, and not David vs Goliath. Anthony Joshua is an Olympic gold medalist, a former unified heavyweight champion, and one of the most proven power punchers in boxing history. Jake Paul stepping into the ring with him is unprecedented — and dangerously real. This breakdown explains why the matchup looks the way it does, why the odds exist, and why the outcome shouldn’t surprise anyone who understands combat sports.",

      "description": "Anthony Joshua raised eyebrows by ranking Jake Paul ahead of Tyson Fury in his heavyweight rankings — and it didn’t land the way he hoped. This wasn’t confidence. It was promotion. And it may have cost Joshua credibility instead of building anticipation. Joshua never faced anyone as inexperienced as Jake Paul in his amateur career, let alone at the elite level. When you’re already the king, you don’t need to exaggerate the threat — you let the result speak for itself. There are very few moments in a fighter’s career when victory feels inevitable. This is one of them. And instead of enjoying that position, Joshua tried to manufacture danger where none exists. Sometimes the smartest move is saying nothing at all.",

He’s an Olympic champion. And no matter how creative the scenario gets, this is not a real-life David vs Goliath story. Chael explains why power isn’t something you can manifest on fight night. Even if Jake landed clean — even if everything went perfectly — the ability to seriously hurt Anthony Joshua simply does not exist. This isn’t disrespect. It’s physics. It’s experience. And it’s the difference between a professional heavyweight champion and a boxer who’s still learning what real danger feels like. The main event sounds good on paper — but reality always shows up eventually.",

Chael Sonnen says you should’ve listened — because height might be the most underrated weapon in combat sports. In this clip, Chael breaks down why the “tale of the tape” obsessions usually miss the point. Age? Overrated. Weight? Misleading. Reach? Useful — but it’s not the whole story. The one category that quietly controls everything is height, because height creates leverage… and leverage changes exchanges in ways fans don’t even look for. Chael explains the part nobody talks about: boxing has wrestling. The tie-ups, the clinches, the leaning, the head position — all those ugly in-between moments decide fights, especially when a taller man can grab, lean, and sap energy without ever getting penalized. Chael points to classic examples like Holyfield vs. Tyson and even McGregor vs. Mayweather to show how “legal illegal” clinch work becomes a skill — and why a taller athlete owns that space. So when Jake Paul is giving up seven inches to Anthony Joshua, the danger isn’t “can Jake reach him?” It’s everything that happens between the punches.

      "description": "Is Anderson Silva vs. Tyron Woodley actually cool… or is this one step too far? Chael Sonnen isn’t asking who wins — he’s asking something way more interesting: do you want this fight? Because Chael does… and not for the reasons you think. In this breakdown, Chael explains why he loves seeing a guy like Silva compete when he clearly doesn’t need the money — and why that matters in a sport where too many fighters are only motivated by a paycheck. Chael also tells a behind-the-scenes story tied to the long UFC antitrust case and the settlement process — including how some fighters almost missed their window to file claims, and how a last-minute message helped get Silva’s paperwork handled in time. (Chael claims Silva’s settlement number was enormous — the point is: Silva isn’t doing this for rent money.) Then Chael flips it to Woodley: different motivations, same result — two competitors who still want to test themselves. And if this fight happens, Chael asks the bigger question: what’s next? Does the winner get pulled into another big-name matchup? Sound off: Is Silva vs Woodley something you’d actually watch — and should it happen at all?

Chael Sonnen explains why Jake Paul vs. Anthony Joshua isn’t just another controversial boxing matchup — it’s the biggest sporting mismatch he’s ever seen. Bigger than lopsided high school blowouts. Bigger than playground mismatches. Bigger than anything that’s ever been sold on a global stage. Chael breaks down why this fight is fundamentally different from every other Jake Paul bout. Joshua isn’t just more experienced. He isn’t just bigger. He isn’t just stronger. He checks every box — size, power, reach, athleticism, pedigree, Olympic credentials — and leaves Jake without a single measurable advantage. From Michael Bisping’s blunt assessment to the uncomfortable moment when professional boxers publicly predicted Jake Paul to win, Chael explains why popularity, business relationships, and promotion can distort reality — and why boxing doesn’t work that way once the bell rings. This isn’t about liking or disliking Jake Paul. Chael makes that clear. It’s about danger, stakes, and the difference between being good at boxing and being one of the best heavyweight athletes in the world. Chael also explains the real risk: not a quick knockout — but prolonged damage if Joshua chooses to carry the fight. This is the breakdown nobody else is willing to give.

      "description": "Chael Sonnen weighs in on one of the most surprising moments involving John Cena — and he doesn’t believe it was scripted the way people think. According to Chael, this wasn’t a case of the booker telling Cena to tap. This was something else entirely. Chael explains the difference between tapping to pain and tapping to a choke. If Cena had been caught in a leg lock or a figure-four, a tap would make sense to avoid injury. But that’s not what happened. Cena tapped to a choke — the one thing that carries a completely different meaning in combat sports. That’s the “forbidden fruit.” Chael makes it clear: John Cena is not a real-life submission fighter, and because of that, he would understand exactly what tapping to a choke represents. It’s not about pain tolerance. It’s about being caught with no way out. That’s why this moment stands out, and why Chael believes Cena thought he was reacting in a real scenario — possibly even misunderstanding the situation in the moment. This clip dives into psychology, perception, and why certain actions carry weight beyond pro wrestling storytelling. Whether you’re a WWE fan, an MMA fan, or someone who understands the symbolism of a tap, Chael breaks down why this moment matters more than people realize.",

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL ! #bruntpochael Joshua says Jake Paul is ranked higher than Tyson Fury — and that’s where things go off the rails. This isn’t trash talk. This isn’t hype. This is a statement that forces a deeper look at fighter psychology and the business of selling fights. Joshua is heading into the easiest matchup of his career, and instead of enjoying that position, he’s trying to manufacture legitimacy where none is required. Why would an Olympic gold medalist and former heavyweight champion build up an opponent this inexperienced? Why say something that clearly isn’t true? Because fighters want one thing more than belts or money — they want credit. They want to hear “good job.” And when a win is so obvious that praise won’t naturally come, some fighters try to preserve it ahead of time by inflating the threat. That strategy doesn’t help Jake Paul. It doesn’t help boxing. And it doesn’t help Anthony Joshua. If you’re king of the world, act like it. You don’t need to pretend this is competitive. This breakdown explains why Joshua said it, why it backfires, and why comments like this create unnecessary doubt around fights that should be straightforward.

      "description": "Dana White hinted that there was more going on behind the scenes — “man stuff” that doesn’t get talked about publicly — and Chael Sonnen breaks down how that directly affected Arman Tsarukyan’s title shot. According to Chael, it was never realistic for the winner of Dan Hooker vs Arman Tsarukyan to turn around fast enough for a January title fight. Whether the belt was going to be contested against Ilia Topuria or later revealed to be an interim championship, the opportunity to cash in that “golden ticket” of number-one contendership simply never materialized. And if the opportunity never existed, Chael explains, then by definition this wasn’t a snub. Chael also addresses the lingering question: has Arman fully put the past behind him? Serving as a backup fighter, showing up professionally, and taking grappling matches to demonstrate sincerity all help — but is it enough? Chael believes it is. The takeaway is clear: Arman Tsarukyan should absolutely be considered for future world title fights. The road may have stalled, but it wasn’t blocked out of spite or politics — it was timing, logistics, and circumstances fans don’t always see. If you want clarity on UFC title contention, interim belts, and how opportunities actually materialize, this is classic Chael Sonnen analysis.",

      "description": "John Cena versus Gunther was supposed to be a time-honored tradition — pass the torch, do the job, serve the next generation. But that’s not what happened. I respect the tradition. I respect Cena for showing up and making the walk. What I don’t respect is the idea that this was some flawless, noble sacrifice. It wasn’t. And worse, it didn’t help the business. Cena didn’t just lose once — he lost twice. He tapped and lost consciousness. That alone is unnecessary. But then came the real problem: Cena smiling into the camera. Knowing where the lens was. Sending a signal to the audience. That moment erased the entire argument that he was simply doing what was best for business. If the goal was to give Gunther his moment, there was an easy solution: tap, roll out of the ring, fade to black. Spotlight on Gunther. End scene. Instead, Cena stayed, smiled, and went into business for himself. That’s not torch-passing — that’s protecting your own legacy at the expense of the next guy. This isn’t about toughness. This isn’t about ego. It’s about understanding the rules of wrestling psychology and not undercutting the very moment you claim to be giving away. This wasn’t a loss. It wasn’t even a double loss. It was a triple loss — and it was completely avoidable.

      "description": "Chael Sonnen admits it — Jake Paul has never looked better. His movement is sharp, his feet are active, and the power is still there. But that’s exactly what worries Chael heading into a potential fight with Anthony Joshua. According to Chael, Jake Paul does not have the ability to hurt Joshua — and trying to do so would be a massive mistake. The path to success isn’t power; it’s discipline. Chael explains that Jake’s only real opportunity is to box, move, score points, and avoid exchanges. This isn’t about damage — it’s about survival and optics. Chael draws a clear comparison to Conor McGregor vs Floyd Mayweather. When McGregor treated it like a game of touch, he had success. The moment he tried to hurt Floyd, his energy vanished, and the fight ended shortly after. Chael warns Jake not to repeat that same error against a far bigger, more dangerous opponent. This clip highlights a more serious, more prepared version of Jake Paul — but also the thin line between smart boxing and disaster. Preparation matters. Strategy matters. And in this fight, ego could be the most dangerous opponent of all. If you’re following Jake Paul, Anthony Joshua, crossover boxing, and high-level fight strategy, this is classic Chael Sonnen insight.",

      "description": "Michael Bisping said it best: there’s no way on earth Jake Paul knocks out Anthony Joshua. And Chael agrees — not as a hot take, but as a reality check. In this breakdown, Chael goes after one of the most repeated myths in fight culture: “puncher’s chance.” People throw that phrase around like it applies to every matchup, every weekend… and Chael’s calling it what it is: lazy thinking. Joshua is bigger, longer, hits harder, and he’s an Olympic champion. Jake is stepping into a world where you don’t “play boxing,” and if this is a real fight, it’s real danger — not for Joshua. But here’s the twist: the scariest outcome isn’t Joshua blasting him out fast. The worst outcome is Joshua carrying him — touching him up, stretching it out, and letting damage pile up because the show demands more than 30 seconds. That’s the warning. That’s the truth. And Chael’s saying it out loud. #JakePaul #AnthonyJoshua #ChaelSonnen #MichaelBisping #Boxing #FightTalk #CombatSport Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Ilia Topuria didn’t vacate the belt — but the headlines sure made it feel like he did. Chael Sonnen breaks down what actually happened, why the reporting got people confused, and what it means for the UFC’s next move. If Ilia isn’t competing for a while, does the promotion go full interim… or do they keep pretending this is business as usual? Chael also connects the dots on the ripple effects: Justin Gaethje vs Paddy Pimblett getting matched up without it being “undisputed,” why fans assumed a vacancy in the first place, and how Arman Tsarukyan’s path keeps getting reshuffled even after being labeled the clear next contender. Then there’s the part nobody wants to talk about: the pound-for-pound shuffle. Islam Makhachev jumps Ilia in the rankings — without Ilia losing a fight — and Chael explains why that matters if the UFC ever wants to sell Islam vs Ilia as more than “just another super fight.” Bottom line: if Ilia’s sidelined, the UFC needs a clean solution — not confusion, not half-measures, and not misleading narratives. #UFC #ChaelSonnen #IliaTopuria #IslamMakhachev #P4P #MMANews #Gaethje #PaddyPimblett Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
