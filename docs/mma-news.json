      "description": "Everyone knew who number one was going to be. In this episode, Chael Sonnen breaks down why Conor McGregor remains the most compelling figure in MMA heading into 2026 — despite not having fought in years. This isn’t about belts. It’s not about rankings. And it’s not about technique. Chael explains that no matter how good Conor is at a specific skill, there’s always another fighter who can match it. What can’t be matched is the one thing no other fighter has: the mandate of the masses. If Conor wants a fight in February, it happens. If he wants a new weight class in March, it exists. No other fighter — not champions, not contenders — has that kind of pull. From media demand to promotional leverage, Chael lays out why Conor can still command attention from outlets, promoters, and fans in a way no one else can. He also addresses the uncertainty around Conor’s future — boxing, MMA, or retirement — and why the real answer may already be written. Chael reflects on Conor’s withdrawal from the Michael Chandler fight, his relationship with Dana White, and why talk of title fights or matchups with Islam Makhachev may be more fantasy than reality. Love him or hate him, one thing is undeniable: Conor McGregor is still the biggest draw in MMA — and still the number one fighter to watch in 2026.

I also react to Joe Rogan’s comments, share my own experience fighting with eye damage, and explain why the UFC may be forced to introduce an interim heavyweight title fight if Aspinall is sidelined for months.

      "description": "What if there’s no middle ground? In this episode, Chael Sonnen opens his 2026 Fighters to Watch countdown with a hard truth about Justin Gaethje: by this time next year, he’ll either be a world champion — or he’ll be gone. Not fading. Not hanging on. Gone. Chael reflects on the moment every fighter eventually faces — the realization that the sport doesn’t last forever, and that one day it ends whether you’re ready or not. From there, he explains why Gaethje stands apart from so many others at lightweight. This isn’t about money. It isn’t about fame. And it isn’t about not knowing how to leave. Justin Gaethje knows exactly what he wants. With an interim title opportunity at 155 pounds looming, Chael questions the very idea of “interim champions,” calling it a title of grace — and explains why, if Gaethje wins, that belt must become undisputed. If a champion can’t or won’t fight, the belt belongs to the man who will. Chael also breaks down why Gaethje’s mindset matters: when he says “give me a title fight or send me home,” he means it — and he’s willing to step aside cleanly if it doesn’t happen. The looming question: is that enough to beat Paddy Pimblett? That breakdown comes later. For now, this is about stakes, honesty, and a fighter who refuses to linger. Number five on the list: Justin Gaethje. #JustinGaethje #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMA2026 #LightweightDivision #FightAnalysis #FightersToWatchBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

In this episode, Chael Sonnen explains why Jake Paul belongs in the conversation heading into 2026: because every door is open. Boxing is the obvious lane, but Chael argues the bigger story is Jake’s obsession with competition — and the idea that MMA has always been sitting in the background. Chael revisits early footage and rumors that shaped the “Paul brothers can fight” narrative, then zooms out to what actually drives Jake: grit, self-belief, toughness, and the willingness to do the hard work that most people never fully give credit for. This isn’t about a clean jab or perfect fundamentals — it’s about proving he belongs in the arena at all. From the early “celebrity boxing” perception to the moment Jake started chasing legitimacy — rankings, world titles, and the biggest names possible — Chael breaks down how the experiment changed, and why the crowd still refuses to admit what’s right in front of them. And here’s the key: Chael believes everything is still on the table for Jake Paul in 2026… including retirement.

      "description": "Number three on the 2026 fighters-to-watch list is the most complicated name of them all. In this episode, Chael Sonnen explains why Francis Ngannou remains one of the most fascinating figures in combat sports — even though no one, including Francis himself, seems certain about what comes next. Chael pulls back the curtain on what fighters don’t realize until it’s gone: how rare the opportunity to compete truly is. Opponents, promoters, licensing, medicals, venues — everything has to align just to make a fight possible. And once those pieces stop lining up, careers don’t fade… they end. That’s the crossroads Francis now stands at. Chael breaks down the reality of boxing options at this stage of Ngannou’s career, why big-name boxers and promoters may hesitate, and why passing on a massive payday against Jake Paul revealed something important about Francis’ mindset. This isn’t about easy money — it’s about meaning. So where does MMA fit? Chael explores the Professional Fighters League as the most realistic path forward, and dives into potential matchups with Vadim Nemkov or the truly mythical option: Gable Steveson. That leads to the central question of the episode: if you can book any fight, why settle for one that doesn’t matter most? Francis Ngannou still has power. He still has leverage. What remains uncertain is whether the right opportunity — and the right willingness — will present itself in 2026. For that reason alone, Francis Ngannou lands at number three. #FrancisNgannou #ChaelSonnen #MMA #PFL #CombatSports #2026 #FightersToWatchBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "title": "Alex Pereira Could End the GOAT Debate in 2026",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6Fo2G7H7xI",
      "description": "Number two on the 2026 fighters-to-watch list isn’t just about winning fights — it’s about ending arguments. In this episode, Chael Sonnen explains why Alex Pereira is one victory away from doing something no fighter has ever done: ending the GOAT conversation entirely. The “greatest of all time” debate has always been about eras, nostalgia, and fan loyalty. It’s not a tournament — it’s a barroom argument. But Chael lays out the case that a heavyweight championship run in 2026 would eliminate the debate altogether. If Pereira becomes heavyweight champion after already holding world titles at middleweight and light heavyweight, the discussion stops. There’s nothing left to argue. Chael revisits a heated ESPN year-in-review debate with Daniel Cormier and Jon Anik, where he argued Pereira should have been Fighter of the Year simply for holding belts in two divisions within a single calendar year. The argument didn’t win then — but history may prove it right. Now the path is clear, but brutal. To reach heavyweight gold, Pereira would likely have to go through Tom Aspinall, Jon Jones, or Ciryl Gane. Every option is dangerous. Every option is possible. What makes this compelling is motivation. Pereira already holds gold. He doesn’t need to do this. But as Chael explains, once a fighter reaches that level, the only thing left is legacy. If Alex Pereira becomes heavyweight champion in 2026 — interim or undisputed — it won’t just be the biggest story of the year. It may be the final word in MMA greatness. That’s why he comes in at number two. #AlexPereira #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMA2026 #GOATDebate #Heavyweight #CombatSportsBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "title": "UFC Heavyweight Division Is Broken—and Here’s Why",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11YAoqVK4HQ",
      "description": "What’s right in MMA isn’t always what’s popular—and nowhere is that more obvious than the heavyweight division. In this clip, Chael Sonnen breaks down why heavyweight is so difficult to predict, promote, and stabilize. From the lack of elite wrestling pedigrees to the absence of clear storytelling, this division doesn’t function like the others—and pretending it does only creates confusion. Chael reacts to conversations around the division involving Jon Jones, Tom Aspinall, and Ciryl Gane, explaining why “big fights” aren’t just opinions—they’re tools. Tools that generate attention, headlines, and engagement… if the story is there. That leads to the biggest question of all: where does Alex Pereira fit into this mess? Does he defend his belt? Does he move up? Does he fight Jon Jones? And if he does—what are they even fighting for? Chael explores interim titles, stripped belts, injured champions, and why Carlos Ulberg may be getting caught in the middle of a situation he didn’t create. The takeaway is simple but uncomfortable: prestige and money aren’t enough. If fans don’t care before the fight, the fight doesn’t matter. This is heavyweight MMA stripped of fantasy booking—what works, what doesn’t, and why the next decision matters more than all the arguments combined. Watch more Chael Sonnen for real fight analysis, promotion logic, and MMA truth-telling. #UFC #Heavyweight #JonJones #AlexPereira #TomAspinall #CirylGane #MMATalk #ChaelSonnenBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "title": "Ian Garry Says Beating Islam Makes Him Pound-for-Pound #1",
      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPrcJu7fVtU",
      "description": "Ian Garry just said the quiet part out loud. Reading his words verbatim, Garry laid out a vision that goes far beyond winning a world title. He claims that when he beats Islam Makhachev, there will be no excuses—and that victory will make him the greatest pound-for-pound fighter in the world. That’s a massive statement. And it raises an even bigger question: How do you become pound-for-pound number one by beating Islam? In this clip, Chael Sonnen breaks down what Garry is really saying, what he might actually be aiming for, and why this isn’t about belts, main events, or even championships. This is about legacy—and about skipping steps that most fighters never even dream of skipping. Chael explores whether Garry is getting ahead of himself, or whether this is the move of a smart storyteller who understands how to place himself in history. From the shadow of Khabib Nurmagomedov to the realities of pound-for-pound rankings, this conversation goes far beyond a single fight. One thing is clear: Ian Garry didn’t say he hopes to be pound-for-pound number one. He said it like a man who believes it’s inevitable. And sometimes, that’s step one. Watch more from Chael Sonnen for unfiltered MMA analysis, rankings debates, and fight philosophy. #IanGarry #IslamMakhachev #UFC #PoundForPound #MMATalk #ChaelSonnen #UFCRankingsBad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Jake Paul wants Francis Ngannou next, and called him soft after getting knocked out by Anthony Joshua in their most recent fight. Daniel Cormier REACTS to Jake's CALLOUT of Francis, and explains why he's going to get knocked out by Francis. DC says that despite lasting more rounds against Joshua than Ngannou did, it was only because of style differences in the boxing ring. Cormier GOES IN ON why Jake Paul will once again get knocked out if he chooses to fight Francis, and breaks down the logic behind Ngannou taking that fight this coming year.
