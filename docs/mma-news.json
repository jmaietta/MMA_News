      "description": "The champ is back — and no, Chael Sonnen isn’t talking about himself. He’s talking about Ilia Topuria. Topuria returning means one thing: massive fights. And on paper, the biggest fight you can possibly make in the sport right now is simple — Ilia Topuria vs. Islam Makhachev. Champion vs. champion. Star vs. star. It sells itself. But Chael says pump the brakes. The UFC likely isn’t booking that unless Ilia gives up his belt or fully commits to lightweight. That’s a big sacrifice — and historically, the company doesn’t force those moves lightly. Which means the fight we think we’re getting… probably isn’t next. So what is? Enter Justin Gaethje. Chael argues we’ve disrespected Gaethje long enough. This isn’t just some action fighter — this is a true competitor. A guy who doesn’t wilt under pressure, doesn’t fold backstage, and definitely doesn’t fold in the cage. Skill for skill, toughness for toughness, Gaethje is a nightmare matchup for anyone — including Topuria. Ilia might be elite. But Justin is something different: proven chaos. If Islam isn’t next, Topuria vs. Gaethje might be the real superfight hiding in plain sight. #IliaTopuria #JustinGaethje #IslamMakhachev #UFC #MMA #Lightweight #ChaelSonnen #CombatSports",

      "description": "Jorge Masvidal just said something that stopped Chael Sonnen in his tracks — he called Ilia Topuria the Michael Jordan of MMA. Think about that. Masvidal didn’t just praise Topuria. He laid out a path to all-time greatness: move up, beat Islam Makhachev, grab a second belt, then chase a third at welterweight. If Ilia holds titles at 145, 155, and 170, Masvidal says you can’t deny him anymore. Not Jon Jones. Not Georges St-Pierre. Not Khabib. Nobody. Chael breaks down how crazy — and how realistic — this actually sounds. Because here’s the twist: Topuria might already be closer than people think. He’s the featherweight champ, he’s proven he can compete at lightweight, and he already owns the BMF title. The only reason he’s not technically a simultaneous multi-division champ? Paperwork and timing. Competition-wise, the skills are there. Power. Boxing. Confidence. Zero fear of moving up. Chael asks the real question: if Topuria beats Islam, does the GOAT debate instantly change? It sounds bold now… until it happens. Then it’ll sound obvious. #IliaTopuria #JorgeMasvidal #IslamMakhachev #UFC #MMA #GOAT #JonJones #GSP #Khabib #ChaelSonnen",

Topuria confirmed that a divorce and settlement are now behind him — information he chose to share publicly, despite having no obligation to do so. While personal disclosures are uncommon, Topuria has consistently shown a willingness to be open with fans and media, even when uncomfortable. As champion, those expectations increase. Media appearances, scheduling obligations, and division momentum become part of the role. Throughout this period, Topuria maintained that he was not injured, but navigating a deeply personal situation involving family — a factor that previously played a central role in his public image. That chapter now appears closed. With it comes a shift. Financial realities change. Motivation evolves. The transition from wanting to fight to needing to fight is a real one in combat sports — and history has shown that such moments can redefine careers. There is a famous expression attributed to Marvin Hagler: “It’s hard to wake up in silk pajamas and go running at 5 a.m.” The point is not wealth — it’s urgency. And urgency has a way of sharpening focus. Topuria’s willingness to return quickly suggests resolution, not hesitation. While speculation around superfights persists, the reality remains unchanged: champions are expected to defend before moving on. For that reason, confidence is high that Ilia Topuria’s return will come against Justin Gaethje — not a divisional leap, and not a delay. This is not a setback story. This is a pivot. And by all indications, it’s a good day for the division.

      "description": "Khamzat Chimaev is doing something Chael Sonnen loves — he’s not letting Alex Pereira breathe. Callouts. Pressure. Constant noise. Chimaev keeps aiming straight at Pereira like a heat-seeking missile. And to Pereira’s credit? He’s not ducking anyone. He’s said it himself — big fights, hard fights, grapplers — he’ll take them all. There’s just one problem. They’re not even in the same weight class. Chael breaks down why this fight sounds great on social media but falls apart in reality. The UFC isn’t going to book it unless someone vacates a belt or completely changes divisions. That’s not a small ask — that’s a career-altering move. So how does Chimaev realistically get there? Meanwhile, Kamaru Usman throws fuel on the fire, questioning the rumors that Chimaev walks around at 230 pounds. If that’s even close to true, what division does he actually belong in? Middleweight? Light heavyweight? Something else entirely? It all creates chaos — but it’s fascinating chaos. Chael explains why Chimaev’s strategy is smart: stay loud, stay visible, force the company’s hand. Because sometimes in the UFC, the fight you get isn’t about rankings… it’s about pressure. And nobody applies pressure like Khamzat. #KhamzatChimaev #AlexPereira #UFC #MMA #KamaruUsman #Middleweight #LightHeavyweight #ChaelSonnen",

Michael Chandler is planning for June 14th — and he’s planning as if he will fight on a historic UFC card at the White House. In a phone call, Chandler made one thing clear: the opponent is irrelevant. Preparation is not. His focus is on being ready for the opportunity, regardless of who stands across from him on the South Lawn. The conversation also addressed the broader uncertainty surrounding the division, including: The continued ambiguity of Conor McGregor’s return Potential BMF title implications Justin Gaethje vs Paddy Pimblett Whether a future Ilia Topuria vs Islam Makhachev matchup belongs at 155 or 170 A common misconception continues to surface: fighters are not sitting on hidden knowledge. In most cases, they learn about matchups and title plans at the same time the public does. What separates Chandler is reliability. He is available, prepared, and unconcerned with narrative control — qualities that consistently place him at the center of major UFC moments. For that reason, confidence remains high that Michael Chandler will be on the White House card, regardless of opponent or title designation.

      "description": "There’s dominant… and then there’s Alexander Volkanovski. Chael Sonnen makes a bold claim in this breakdown: no champion in the UFC has separated himself from the pack like Volk has right now. Not close fights. Not razor-thin decisions. We’re talking five-round shutouts. One judge literally gave him every single round. And here’s the scary part — the number one contender, the guy who beats everybody else in the division? He’s still five rounds worse. That’s not competitive. That’s a gap. Chael compares it to the all-time greats: Khabib Nurmagomedov, Georges St-Pierre, Jon Jones. Those guys had room to spare. They were so far ahead they could afford an off night and still win. Now Volkanovski is in that same rare air. Chael even floats the unthinkable: if Volk stopped training tomorrow — just stopped showing up — would anyone beat him in the next two years? Maybe not. Because that’s how far ahead he is technically, mentally, and strategically. While everyone else is chasing improvements, Volk is already operating at championship autopilot. This isn’t just a title reign. It’s separation. And separation is what creates legends. #AlexanderVolkanovski #UFC #MMA #Featherweight #Khabib #GSP #JonJones #ChaelSonnen",

Historically, that argument makes sense. For years, American wrestlers dominated mixed martial arts. But here’s the question no one is asking: Is the premise even true anymore? Are Eastern European wrestlers really dominating the UFC — or are we confusing Sambo, jiu-jitsu, and MMA-style grappling with Olympic wrestling? In this video, the idea gets broken down clearly: Why Khabib Nurmagomedov and Islam Makhachev don’t represent wrestling Why Georges St-Pierre may be the best wrestling-heavy MMA fighter ever — without wrestling The strange delay in signing Gable Steveson Why elite American wrestlers may not need MMA at all The question isn’t whether American wrestlers can dominate MMA. The real question is whether they should — and whether the problem even exists in the first place. 0:00 – Daniel Cormier Says He Has a Plan Cormier claims he knows how to bring American wrestlers back to MMA dominance. 0:39 – When American Wrestlers Ruled MMA A historically accurate look at the era when U.S. wrestlers “cleaned house.” 1:08 – Are Eastern Europeans Really Dominating?

Former UFC champion Frankie Edgar floated an idea that instantly got the MMA world talking — not calling for retirement, but suggesting that Alexander Volkanovski consider leaving the sport on his own terms. Frankie’s point wasn’t disrespectful. It was reflective. Nobody ever truly gets to go out on top in this game. Fighters stay too long. They lose a step. The ending writes itself. Frankie simply asked: what’s wrong with walking away with your hand raised? Volkanovski has the money. He has the legacy. He has opportunities outside the Octagon. And yet, that’s never been enough for fighters wired like him. After his dominant performance, many expected a farewell. Instead, the bigger question remains — when do you actually call it? Is retirement about no longer being able to compete? Or no longer being able to win? The fighter doesn’t change overnight — only the result does. And that’s what makes this discussion uncomfortable. History tells us most legends don’t stop early. Volkanovski doesn’t seem built that way either. The question isn’t whether he can continue — it’s how long he should. Watch the full breakdown and decide for yourself. #UFC #AlexanderVolkanovski #FrankieEdgar #MMA #UFCNews #FightAnalysis 0:00 – Frankie Edgar Raises the Retirement Question Frankie suggests Volkanovski could retire — not a call, but a reflection. 0:32 – Why Nobody Ever Gets to Go Out on Top The brutal truth about fighters staying too long. 1:21 – The Belief Volkanovski Might Retire Why many thought Saturday night might be the end. 1:52 – Why the Rematch Never Made Sense A one-sided five-round fight and the oddity of an immediate rematch. 2:33 – How Rare a 5–0 Title Fight Really Is Why judges almost never score every round one way. 3:01 – When Do You Actually Call It? The real retirement question fighters can’t answer. 3:22 – Can You Still Compete but Not Be Champion? The uncomfortable middle ground most legends face. 3:23 – Ronda Rousey as the Warning Example When contracts, pay, and titles collide. 3:46 – What If Volkanovski Had Lost? Why the fighter wouldn’t be any different — only the result. 4:13 – Why Winning Changes the Retirement Narrative Same skills, same abilities, different public reaction. 4:27 – Volkanovski’s Personality and the “Bitter End” Why he doesn’t seem wired to walk away early. 4:34 – The Danger of Needing the Next Fight Why not having something to train for is concerning. 4:49 – Kicking the Can Down the Road Why fighters delay the inevitable as long as possible. 5:00 – Coach Lopez Says “Four More Fights” A realistic timeline emerges. 5:07 – The Likely Outcome in History Why this probably ends closer to four more fights than retirement.

      "description": "Shavkat Rakhmonov is the clear number one contender at welterweight — 19 wins, 18 finishes, an absolute monster. But if you take him out of the picture, the entire division suddenly gets weird. Chael Sonnen lays out the problem. If Rakhmonov isn’t available, now what? Because there’s one guy you can’t ignore: Kamaru Usman. Love him or not, Usman isn’t going anywhere. Former champion, still elite, still relevant. Chael argues the path forward has to include him if you want legitimacy at 170. Then there’s the fresh blood. Ian Machado Garry vs. Michael Morales? That’s fireworks. Two young, undefeated (or near-undefeated) contenders, both dangerous, both rising fast. That’s the kind of fight that actually moves the division forward while the title picture sorts itself out. And then Chael throws out the wild one: Islam Makhachev at welterweight. The idea of Islam being the first man to take Usman down and hold him there sounds crazy… but would you watch it? Of course you would. Everybody would. That’s the state of 170 right now — contenders, legends, and chaos all colliding. If Rakhmonov’s sidelined, matchmaking just got very interesting. #ShavkatRakhmonov #KamaruUsman #IanGarry #MichaelMorales #IslamMakhachev #UFC #Welterweight #ChaelSonnen",

In this episode of Ask Uncle Chael, Chael Sonnen tackles some of the most persistent questions MMA fans still argue about today. Did he really not know the rules in the Anderson Silva fight? What was Jon Jones actually like behind the scenes on The Ultimate Fighter? And who was the toughest opponent Chael ever faced that nobody talks about? Chael also breaks down why elite wrestlers so often struggle when they transition to MMA — and explains the single technical mistake that separates wrestlers who succeed in the cage from those who don’t. Later, he revisits the infamous Jon Jones toe injury and shares exactly what was going through his mind in that moment — including whether that fight could have ended differently. This isn’t revisionist history or internet mythology. It’s first-hand insight, told with honesty, humor, and the kind of perspective only a former title challenger can offer. If you’ve ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes, how fighters think in the heat of competition, or why fans so often misunderstand what they’re watching — this one’s for you.

Terms: sportsbook.draftkings.com/promos. Ends 2/15/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. A simple Google search led to one of the most misunderstood narratives in MMA history. Chael Sonnen tells the story of how a routine request from Misha Parsons uncovered four bizarre search questions — including one that would eventually shape his entire public persona. From whether tickling is legal in the UFC, to starting MMA at 27, to the only 17-year-old ever to compete in the promotion, Chael answers them all. But the final question — about his testosterone levels — opens the door to something much bigger. For the first time in detail, Chael explains how a false narrative spread, why defending himself only made it worse, and how he learned a brutal truth about public perception: explaining is losing. This isn’t a story about PEDs. It’s a story about psychology, media, and how reputations are formed. Chael breaks down how a single misleading claim, amplified at the wrong time by the wrong outlet, became the foundation for “The Bad Guy” character — not by design, but by survival. It’s a rare look behind the curtain at how fighters are shaped not just by wins and losses, but by headlines, silence, and restraint. Sometimes the smartest move… is not to fight back. #ChaelSonnen #UFC #MMAHistory #TheBadGuy #CombatSports #MediaNarratives #UFCLegends Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Chael Sonnen breaks down what Ilia’s return window really means, why April and June aren’t accidental, and how the UFC’s recent moves quietly rule out one mega-fight while opening the door to another. For months, Ilia Topuria has been exact with his messaging. Every announcement, every pivot, every delay has proven accurate — even when details were scarce. Now he says he’s ready to fight immediately, and that changes everything. The biggest fight the UFC could make is Ilia Topuria vs. Islam Makhachev. But Chael explains why that fight isn’t happening next, what the company has already decided behind the scenes, and why Justin Gaethje suddenly becomes the most logical opponent. This breakdown also addresses the uncomfortable truth fans don’t want to hear: Conor McGregor is no longer central to the board. Whether due to weight, timing, or leverage, Chael explains why the chess piece may be gone entirely — and why that matters for the White House card. If Ilia is returning, someone dangerous is waiting. And this isn’t about hype — it’s about competition. Watch closely. The clues are all there.

Terms: sportsbook.draftkings.com/promos. Ends 2/15/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. California Baptist University has announced it is discontinuing its wrestling program. On the surface, it looks like a budget decision. In reality, it’s a warning sign. Chael Sonnen explains why this move has far bigger implications than one school or one sport. The NIL era was created to fix a real problem—the NCAA keeping massive revenues while athletes received nothing. That imbalance needed correction. But the current system has created a new one. Money is now being funneled almost entirely into football and men’s basketball. Olympic sports—the very programs that develop discipline, sacrifice, and long-term excellence—are being cut to make room. Wrestling is just one of the first casualties. Sonnen lays out a perspective rarely discussed: Olympic sports matter at a national level. Countries take Olympic performance seriously because it reflects something deeper—discipline, resilience, and the ability of young people to train, sacrifice, follow instruction, and succeed under pressure. That same age group, those same qualities, are what nations quietly measure through Olympic competition. And here’s the part many people miss: Olympic athletes do not come from training centers. They come from universities. The NCAA system feeds freestyle and Greco-Roman wrestling, track and field, gymnastics, and other Olympic disciplines. When college programs disappear, the pipeline collapses. This isn’t nostalgia. It’s infrastructure. Cal Baptist’s decision highlights a growing trend. Olympic sports are being stripped away not because they failed—but because the system around them changed. If this continues, the damage won’t show up immediately. It will show up years later, when the pipeline is gone and can’t be rebuilt. #Wrestling #NIL #NCAA #OlympicSports #CollegeWrestling #ChaelSonnen #CombatSports #USAOlympics Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Terms: sportsbook.draftkings.com/promos. Ends 2/15/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Chael Sonnen believes there is exactly one fighter guaranteed a spot on the UFC White House card: Michael Chandler. Not because of rankings. Not because of wins. But because of loyalty, patience, and timing. If Chandler loses to Conor McGregor, the UFC will want to reward him. Red Panty Night is real, and Chandler earned that opportunity the hard way. He went through The Ultimate Fighter. He waited. He stayed quiet while dates, fights, and promises were dangled in front of him. Through it all, he remained a reliable company guy—and that matters more than people realize. What’s changed is the conversation. For the first time, Chandler publicly spoke about a fight that didn’t involve Conor McGregor. Instead, he talked about the BMF title and specifically mentioned Max Holloway. He even predicted Holloway would beat Charles Oliveira—then made it clear he had his eye on that belt. That omission matters. Chandler has always talked about Conor, even when preparing for other opponents. This time, Conor wasn’t mentioned at all. Behind the scenes, things have gone quiet. McGregor’s suspension paused the conversation. Then came comments about contracts, phone calls with Ari Emanuel, and uncertainty about timelines. After doing the legwork, Sonnen says this isn’t public negotiation or chess—it’s distance. The Chandler vs. McGregor fight isn’t happening. So what do you do with Chandler? Big fights are still available. A BMF matchup fits his profile. And regardless of opponent, Sonnen is confident Chandler won’t just be on the White House card—he’ll be on the main card. The only remaining question is who stands across from him. #UFC #MichaelChandler #ConorMcGregor #BMFTitle #MaxHolloway #MMA #FightBusiness #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

Terms: sportsbook.draftkings.com/promos. Ends 2/15/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Jon Jones didn’t announce a retirement—but he may have said enough to take himself out of contention. In a recent conversation, Jones turned down a proposed wrestling match with Daniel Cormier under the Real American Freestyle banner. That part alone isn’t shocking. What caught attention was the explanation. Jones said he has severe arthritis in his hip and qualifies for a hip replacement. He admitted his last two training camps were a struggle and made it clear that what he has left physically matters to him—especially with a young son at home. Officially, all Jones did was decline a wrestling match. But if the explanation is taken at face value, it raises a larger question. If Jones cannot wrestle because of his hip, what does that say about MMA? Wrestling is foundational to mixed martial arts, and the statement inevitably leads people to wonder whether Jones is still physically able—or willing—to compete at the highest level. The timing matters. Alex Pereira recently said he would not be fighting Jon Jones at the White House event, and Jones himself made no mention of fighting in this interview. Notably, he also made no reference to the White House at all—something he had consistently done in prior appearances. There is another interpretation. Jones may simply be preserving what he has left for one final MMA run and refusing to spend it on a wrestling camp. Arthritis doesn’t automatically mean surgery, and declining one competition doesn’t equal stepping away from another. Still, the silence is new. The absence of callouts is new. And the emphasis on life after fighting is new. Taken together, it’s fair to ask whether Jon Jones just quietly removed himself from the White House conversation—without ever saying the words. #JonJones #UFC #DanielCormier #AlexPereira #MMA #FightBusiness #CombatSports #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
