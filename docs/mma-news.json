      "description": "Dana White just made a major change to the UFC bonus system. The traditional discretionary bonuses — where fighters across the card received checks ranging from $5,000 to $25,000 — are officially gone. Now, only finishes earn a $25,000 bonus, changing how fighters get rewarded after every event. This move could completely reshape: • Fighter incentives • Fight strategies • Risk-taking in the cage • Pay structure across the card 💬 Is this better for fighters — or worse? Should UFC reward performance or only finishes? 👇 Drop your take in the comments. #UFC #DanaWhite #MMA #UFCPay #UFCSalary #FightBonus #CombatSports Website: http://www.MMAWeekly.com/ Subscribe on Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=MMAWeeklyVideos Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/MMAWeeklycom-176775391774/ Twitter: https://twitter.com/MMAWeeklycom/ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/mmaweekly/",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nO4SHHbdcKw",
      "description": "Chael Sonnen breaks down why he initially believed Paddy Pimblett would defeat Justin Gaethje, and how fight week completely changed the narrative once the cage door closed. Sonnen explains how Gaethje’s unusual demeanor throughout fight week—angrier, more confrontational, and visibly irritated—signaled that something different was coming. While Sonnen originally leaned toward Pimblett based on youth, momentum, and grappling upside, Gaethje’s pressure, conditioning, and control quickly dismantled that expectation. The analysis focuses on Gaethje’s ability to dictate where fights take place. Using elite anti-wrestling, forward pressure, and relentless pace, Gaethje kept the fight exactly where he wanted it—on the feet, moving forward, and backing Pimblett up. Sonnen explains why backing up is one of the hardest things for a wrestler to overcome, and how Gaethje’s pressure neutralized Pimblett’s offense round after round. Sonnen also addresses the narrative of “old” or “vintage” Gaethje, explaining why this wasn’t a resurgence at all—but simply the same fighter fans have always seen. Gaethje walks opponents down, breaks them over time, and refuses to give ground. Finally, Sonnen looks ahead at what this result means for the lightweight division, including potential future opponents and why the loser of this fight may have ended up in a better position than the winner. Watch the full breakdown and decide for yourself. #UFC #JustinGaethje #PaddyPimblett #MMA #UFCLightweight #FightAnalysis #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Get $10 Off @BRUNT with code CHAEL at https://bruntworkwear.com/CHAEL ! #bruntpochael Chael Sonnen breaks down why the outcome of Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett was far more predictable than it appeared heading into fight night. In this analysis, Sonnen explains how press conferences and fight-week behavior are often misunderstood. While most fans watch for entertainment, experienced analysts look for tells—subtle indicators of confidence, clarity, and realistic paths to victory. According to Sonnen, both fighters already knew who the better athlete was. The real question was never who would win, but how. Sonnen walks through Pimblett’s only viable strategy: submission. He then methodically explains why that path required a series of unlikely events—multiple takedowns, sustained control, positional advancement, and a finish against one of the best anti-wrestlers in the sport. By contrast, Gaethje’s path to victory was simple and immediate. The fight begins on the feet, and Gaethje thrives there. The breakdown also explores why submissions at the elite level are often the result of fatigue rather than dominance, and why expecting Gaethje to quit under pressure was unrealistic. Sonnen compares Pimblett’s challenge to the difficulty elite fighters like Khabib Nurmagomedov and Michael Chandler had keeping Gaethje down. Finally, Sonnen explains why outside influence—conversations with respected fighters and coaches—temporarily shifted his prediction, and how fight week ultimately revealed the truth. This is a masterclass in reading fights before they happen. #UFC #JustinGaethje #PaddyPimblett #MMA #FightAnalysis #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

In this breakdown, Sonnen explains why the matchup never fully made sense going in. There was no personal rivalry, no promotional tension, and very little upside for O’Malley despite the risk. The crowd reaction, the momentum shifts during the fight, and the uncertainty afterward all reinforced how razor-thin the margin was. Sonnen also addresses why many fans felt Song Yadong did enough to win, and why the decision was met with immediate pushback inside the arena. He compares this moment to other situations where elite fighters were handed difficult assignments with no obvious reward—something that has become a recurring test at the top of the sport. While Sonnen disagreed with the scorecards, he explains why this fight represented the ask—the moment when a champion is expected to accept danger without complaint. O’Malley did exactly that, survived a tough opponent, and still walked away with the victory. The question now is simple: what comes next for the UFC bantamweight division?

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Conor McGregor says his UFC contract may no longer exist — and that claim changes everything. In this video, Chael Sonnen examines McGregor’s public statement that the UFC’s Paramount deal voided his existing contract and explains why, regardless of legal technicalities, the claim itself matters. If a fighter asserts there is no deal, the promotion cannot simply move forward as if one exists. Chael walks through how the UFC historically handles contract disputes, why litigation is rarely the path taken, and how recent developments — including the sudden removal of McGregor from a proposed White House card — give unexpected weight to McGregor’s position. While the legal argument may be weak on paper, the real-world consequences are not. The breakdown also explores the ripple effects on the event itself, the uncertainty surrounding the White House card, and why Michael Chandler appears caught in the middle of a larger negotiation strategy. With suspension timelines, promotional commitments, and public messaging all colliding, this has become one of the strangest booking situations the UFC has faced in years. This isn’t prediction or hype. It’s an examination of what the available facts actually suggest — and why the situation may be far more unresolved than it appears.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Being the best fighter and being the biggest star are not the same thing — and the UFC has never pretended otherwise. In this video, Chael Sonnen breaks down what actually defines the biggest star in the UFC. It isn’t rankings. It isn’t belts. And it isn’t who would win a fantasy matchup on paper. It’s who moves people, fills buildings, and commands attention the moment they walk into an arena. Sonnen explains how the UFC signals its priorities, why audience reaction matters more than technical dominance, and how production choices, walkouts, and crowd participation reveal who the company is truly backing. He also examines why some fighters dominate headlines without dominating divisions — and why that distinction is intentional. The conversation touches on recent media narratives, star-making moments, and the difference between being respected inside the sport and being relevant outside of it. Sonnen outlines how stars are built, how they’re protected, and why “best fighter” arguments often miss the point entirely. This isn’t a prediction. It’s an explanation. If the question is who the UFC revolves around — not who wins rounds, but who drives the business — this is where the answer lives.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? A headline coming out of weigh-ins claimed Patty Pimblett held a size advantage over Justin Gaethje. That claim doesn’t survive even a basic look at how weight classes actually work. Both fighters weighed in at 155 pounds. That’s not a suggestion, not a range — it’s a hard number. At that point, size advantages don’t exist. Lightweight is lightweight. Enough is enough. In this video, Chael Sonnen breaks down why face-off photos and surface-level narratives keep misleading fans during fight week. He explains how gyms actually separate athletes by real size, why fighters within certain ranges are effectively the same weight, and why “size advantage” headlines often collapse under scrutiny. The conversation also explores the strange incentives created by modern weight cutting, why weigh-ins have become more theatrical than functional, and how post-weigh-in rehydration blurs reality even further. This isn’t about criticizing fighters or reporters. It’s about precision. If a claim can’t hold up to basic logic, it shouldn’t be repeated — no matter how good it sounds in a headline.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Cameron Smotherman made weight — and then his body gave out. He stepped on the scale at 135.5 pounds, officially cleared the limit, took a few steps, and collapsed moments later. No theatrics. No exaggeration. Just a visible example of what extreme weight cutting can look like when the margin disappears. The moment wasn’t about the fall itself. It was about the fact that Smotherman still made weight. That detail matters. Whatever misery the cut required, whatever strain it placed on the body, the job was finished before the system failed. That is toughness — and it also highlights a problem the sport continues to acknowledge without meaningfully fixing. This issue has been solved before. The NCAA ended extreme weight cutting decades ago, not through discussion panels or medical speculation, but by changing the weigh-in window. When athletes were required to compete shortly after weighing in, dehydration stopped immediately. The incentive disappeared. A weigh-in held a full day before competition is no longer functional. It serves marketing purposes, not competitive ones. Fighters rehydrate, reconstitute, and often enter the cage at drastically different weights than what was measured. Fighters are adults, and they will always pursue advantages within the rules. But there is a cost — and this time, that cost was caught on video. The hope is that Smotherman is healthy and recovers fully. The larger hope is that moments like this finally lead to action instead of repetition.

Certain names dominate the conversation, certain questions get asked, and certain narratives take over the room. This time, Chael Sonnen found himself genuinely stumped — and that doesn’t happen often. In this clip, Chael works through a deceptively simple question: Who actually has to be on the rumored White House card? What starts as a thought exercise quickly turns into a deeper breakdown of timing, leverage, availability, and how the UFC really builds landmark events. Rather than speculating wildly, Chael sticks to what can be observed — who is penciled in, who isn’t, and why some obvious names don’t actually make sense once you look at dates, divisions, and championship obligations. Along the way, Chael addresses fighters like Max Holloway, Michael Chandler, Jon Jones, and Gable Steveson, explaining why popularity alone doesn’t guarantee placement — and why some divisions, particularly heavyweight, remain unresolved heading into a potential tentpole event. This isn’t about predictions or inside promises. It’s about understanding how UFC media days work, why certain fights get momentum, and how silence can sometimes tell you more than headlines. If you follow fight-week coverage, card construction, or the business logic behind major UFC events, this breakdown offers a clear-eyed look at what actually matters — and what doesn’t. Watch the full analysis and decide for yourself who truly belongs on a White House card.

      "description": "Michael Bisping sits down with Derrick Lewis, the Black Beast, ahead of his showdown with Waldo Cortes-Acosta. Lewis explains why he sees Waldo as a “different version of Roy Nelson,” calls him a one-trick pony built around the right hand, and says he expects to get him out of there in the very first exchange. He talks about being locked in all week, cutting weight at heavyweight, how his training has evolved from the “30 minutes a day” days to serious two-session work, and why the current heavyweight title picture drama doesn’t interest him. Derrick also discusses whether an interim title could be next if the champion is sidelined, why the UFC will always chase the biggest ticket-seller, and how he turns into a completely different person on fight night—leading to the legendary post-fight moments that fans can’t forget. 🔒 Become a Member for special Perks, Exclusive Content and ultra-exclusive Live Chats: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrG2_1TcVkXKXXsD6Kjwig/join #bisping #ufc #mma #mixedmartialarts #michaelbisping #ufcnews #mmanews #ufc324 #derricklewis",

In this episode, I sit down and answer fan questions spanning the full spectrum of MMA: training camps, old-school tournaments, Jon Jones, Gable Steveson, and how this sport actually works behind the scenes. We talk about why “camp” became a thing in MMA, what really matters in tournament fighting, and why some matchups make sense on paper — and some don’t. I also address questions about Jon Jones’ influence, Gable Steveson’s ceiling, and what separates dangerous fighters from proven draws. No hot takes for the sake of noise. Just honest answers, real context, and a few stories along the way.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. Why is this fight happening — and what does it actually lead to? Chael Sonnen makes a clear prediction: Paddy Pimblett is going to beat Justin Gaethje — and Chael explains why this conclusion has nothing to do with curses, hype, or disrespect. Chael walks through Justin Gaethje’s public stance heading into the fight, including the talk of “title shot or retirement,” and why that kind of language historically creates problems. Chael doesn’t accuse Gaethje of quitting — but he does question whether that mindset signals urgency or a fighter with one foot out the door. The discussion also touches on Gaethje’s recent arguments about belts, bonuses, and recognition, and why those points didn’t fully add up in Chael’s view — especially given that two of Gaethje’s last four fights were already for belts. Chael explains why talking about money, retirement, and past accomplishments is a dangerous place to live when the opponent is fully focused on what comes next. On the other side, Chael points out that Paddy Pimblett isn’t carrying any of that baggage. No talk of last runs. No negotiation posture. Just forward momentum and a clear target — which Chael believes matters more than people realize. Chael closes by explaining why mindset, timing, and focus — not resumes — are what swing this fight.

Ends 1/25/26 at 11:59 PM ET. Sponsored by DK. On fight week, certain things usually happen. One of them is Conor McGregor taking over the conversation. This time, that didn’t happen. In this clip, Chael Sonnen walks through why the current Conor McGregor story feels different — not because of what Conor said, but because of what didn’t happen afterward. Conor made multiple headline-level claims in a matter of days, including statements about his contract status and his future with the UFC. Historically, those moments dominate fight week. This time, they didn’t. Chael breaks down the unusual silence surrounding Conor on media day, why no one asked the expected questions, and why that absence matters more than any tweet. The discussion isn’t about rumors or predictions — it’s about leverage, timing, and how attention actually works during a UFC fight week. Using past examples, Chael explains how Conor has historically redirected the spotlight, why that tactic worked for years, and why this moment stands out as something new. Whether this shift is temporary or meaningful remains unclear — but the change itself is undeniable. If you follow UFC media cycles, fighter negotiations, or how fight week narratives are built, this is a rare look at what happens when the usual pattern breaks. Watch the full breakdown, and decide for yourself what this silence really means.

Chael Sonnen looks at the booking of Sean O’Malley vs. Song Yadong and admits something unusual: there has to be a reason — but nobody’s saying it out loud. Chael breaks down O’Malley’s own explanation for the matchup, including his clear roadmap toward another title run and the stakes he’s publicly put on himself. But when it comes to Song Yadong, the picture gets murkier. If Song wins, does he jump the line? Is this quietly a No. 1 contender fight? Or is it something else entirely? Chael also brings in broader context from the bantamweight division — including Merab Dvalishvili, Petr Yan, and the unanswered questions surrounding divisional hierarchy. One side is creating urgency. The other isn’t. And that matters. The result? A compelling fight with unclear consequences — and Chael isn’t convinced that’s an accident. Watch, then decide for yourself: is this a true title eliminator… or a matchup waiting for its meaning?

By calling it “title or bust,” Sean raised the stakes himself, and that decision reshapes how this matchup has to be viewed. In this breakdown, Chael looks at why O’Malley vs. Song Yadong feels confusing on paper, yet compelling in context. The talent level isn’t the issue. The question is what the fight represents. If Sean wins, the path forward is clear. If he doesn’t, the pressure he created complicates everything — not because the UFC said so, but because he did. Chael walks through the ripple effects across the bantamweight division, including where this leaves Merab Dvalishvili, Umar Nurmagomedov, and the ongoing title picture involving Petr Yan. With no straight-line bracket, pressure and perception suddenly matter as much as rankings. This isn’t about predicting retirement or manufacturing drama. It’s about understanding how fighters sometimes create stakes that force the promotion — and the audience — to look at a fight differently. That’s why this matchup matters. And that’s why the stakes feel real.
