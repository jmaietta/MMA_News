      "description": "On this episode of Good Guy / Bad Guy…Will UFC 321 decide who the greatest heavyweight is when Tom Aspinall puts his title on the line against Ciryl Gane? Or will another name be making headlines when it’s all said and done? You do not want to miss what the guys think Monday’s headline will be. Then, the women’s strawweight belt is up for grabs in the co-main event. And it’s a rematch five years in the making when Virna Jandiroba takes on Mackenzie Dern. But does their first fight even matter once that Octagon door closes? Plus, to throw in the towel or not throw in the towel? That is the question when it comes to Reiner de Ridder and the decision to save him from being mauled by Brendan Allen in the fifth round last week in Vancouver. Find out if the Good Guy or Bad Guy believe it was the right decision and if it changes RDR’s aura moving forward. #ESPN #MMA #UFC ✔ For more UFC, sign up for ESPN+ http://espnplus.com/ufc/youtube ✔ Get the ESPN App: http://www.espn.com/espn/apps/espn ✔ Subscribe to ESPN on YouTube: http://es.pn/SUBSCRIBEtoYOUTUBE ✔ Subscribe to ESPN FC on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoESPNFC ✔ Subscribe to NBA on ESPN on YouTube: http://bit.ly/SUBSCRIBEtoNBAonESPN ✔ Watch ESPN on YouTube TV: http://es.pn/YouTubeTV",

Chael Sonnen breaks down why fans may be jumping ahead of the story. With Jon Jones sidelined, the heavyweight division’s wide open — but how much of Aspinall’s hype comes from timing, and how much comes from talent? Before crowning him the next great heavyweight, Chael says we need to see what happens with Gane vs. Aspinall, Jones vs. Miocic, and how the division resets in 2025. #TomAspinall #ChaelSonnen #UFCHeavyweight #JonJones #CirylGane #UFCLondon #MMA #UFCNews Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 All things UFC and MMA with the undefeated Bad Guy, Chael Sonnen.

On this edition, he and MMA Junkie reporter Danny Segura discuss the following: (00:00) - Intro (01:19) - We overestimated Reinier de Ridder, and his loss to Brendan Allen proved that he isn’t UFC champion material. (06:31) - UFC 321: Anything other than a dominant performance from Tom Aspinall would be disappointing. (11:13) - UFC 321: If Mackenzie Dern doesn’t win this vacant title, she’ll officially be considered a bust. (15:58) - UFC 321: Nobody has more pressure to win than Umar Nurmagomedov. (21:45) - Khamzat Chimaev doesn't deserve to challenge Alex Pereira for the light heavyweight title. (24:28) - Sean Brady got screwed over by the UFC.

Chael Sonnen breaks down what went wrong for RDR, the key moments that shifted the fight, and how his corner handled the pressure. From strategy mistakes to mental challenges, Chael dives into the lessons every fighter — and fan — should understand. He also talks about why it’s important to wait and see how the UFC heavyweight division develops, especially with the upcoming Gane vs Aspinall fight, and why the direction of the middleweight division matters before making predictions or assumptions about fighters’ next steps. Discussion:Do you think RDR made the right choices in the Octagon, or could he have handled things differently? And how do you see the UFC heavyweight and middleweight divisions shaping up after these fights?
