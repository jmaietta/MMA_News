In this clip, Chael Sonnen revisits the short-lived fight between Ciryl Gane and Tom Aspinall and points out a moment that many fans may have completely missed. A failed takedown attempt, a sudden eye poke, and the narrative that the fight was destined to stay a kickboxing match — but was it? Chael breaks down why some believe Gane was starting to find his rhythm, why a training partner thinks Gane could have finished Aspinall, and why three minutes simply isn’t enough time to know who the better heavyweight really is. Was Gane’s footwork and speed beginning to matter? Or was Aspinall always one step ahead? According to Chael, the truth may be more unclear than people want to admit.",

      "description": "There’s a lot being said about the rumored White House fight card—and most of it doesn’t survive even a basic reality check. In this piece, I revisit the claims going around about a massive White House UFC-style event, including rumors of seven world title fights, fighters being held back from other cards, and the idea that pay-per-view is suddenly dead. These stories gained traction fast—but traction doesn’t mean truth. Let’s start with the contradictions. The same rumors pushing seven title fights are also telling you that Conor McGregor is headlining… and that a potential **Jon Jones vs Alex Pereira fight is the main attraction. None of those fights involve a belt. All of these things cannot be true at the same time. History matters here. Promoters don’t stack cards with endless title fights because it kills pacing, time, and broadcast structure. The biggest fights we’ve seen recently—**Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul, or the return of Conor—worked because there was no belt attached. If this were real breaking news, you wouldn’t hear it from anonymous sources. You’d hear it from Dana White. And you didn’t. The fight business runs on numbers, not fantasies. Very few people ever had to make those numbers work.

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqnXxXbHklY",
      "description": "A tough question has emerged around Tom Aspinall—and it isn’t as straightforward as it sounds. If Aspinall were forced to retire today due to injury, where would he rank in the history of the UFC heavyweight division? Not long ago, Aspinall was widely viewed as the first legitimate favorite to defeat Jon Jones. Sportsbooks reflected that belief, something no previous opponent had ever achieved. From a potential standpoint, that alone places Aspinall in rare company. But greatness debates rarely stay focused on potential. They almost always drift toward resumes. Title wins. Defenses. Longevity. And that’s where the conversation becomes complicated. Heavyweight history is uniquely difficult to compare across eras. Earlier champions often competed at heavyweight due to limited divisions, not size or athletic ceiling. Modern heavyweights like Aspinall represent a different physical standard altogether—but resumes still matter. This breakdown explores the tension between peak ability and documented accomplishment, using past champions as context while examining why Aspinall’s case doesn’t fit neatly into traditional rankings. He may possess the highest upside the division has ever seen, yet still fall outside many all-time lists if careers are measured strictly by achievements. The question isn’t meant as criticism. It’s an honest look at how greatness is judged—and why Tom Aspinall’s story isn’t finished yet. #TomAspinall #UFC #Heavyweight #MMA #JonJones #GOATDebate #FightAnalysis #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "A controversial question is back on the table: could Ciryl Gane have beaten—and even finished—Tom Aspinall if their fight continued? One of Gane’s training partners believes the momentum was swinging so hard that Gane wasn’t just going to win… he was going to stop him. This breakdown revisits what actually happened in the short window the fans got to see. The matchup quickly turned into a kickboxing fight—Gane is a professional kickboxer, while Aspinall’s striking pedigree has been built primarily in the gym and in MMA rounds. On paper, that dynamic favors Gane the longer the fight goes, while Aspinall’s best chance typically comes early as the heavier power puncher. But there’s one moment that gets overlooked: Aspinall’s takedown attempt that “missed by a mile.” Many used that as proof the fight would always stay on the feet. The argument here is different—rewatching suggests the entry wasn’t simply poor timing or distance. The claim is that an earlier eye poke helped steer Aspinall off the shot before the fight-ending sequence ever happened. If that’s true, it changes the conversation. Not because it declares a winner, but because it reframes the wrestling question and what each man can adjust in a rematch. Can Aspinall actually get to the hips if the setup is clean? Can Gane consistently manage the entries without fouls while using footwork to extend the fight? Three minutes is not enough to “solve” this matchup—but it’s enough to make the rematch even more compelling. #UFC #TomAspinall #CirylGane #MMA #Heavyweight #FightAnalysis #Rematch #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

And based on what we just saw, this fight is incredibly intriguing, even if it’s unlikely to go Jake’s way. Chael breaks down why Jake Paul vs Francis Ngannou makes sense, what a win would actually mean, and whether this is the kind of fight you take to go out on top — or if Jake is the kind of competitor who can never stop chasing “one more.” This isn’t about hype anymore.

      "description": "Another Conor McGregor tweet made headlines—and that’s exactly why it matters. When Conor McGregor jokingly challenged Floyd Mayweather to an MMA fight at the White House, it was absurd by design. No other fighter—regardless of star power—could post something that ridiculous and still dominate the news cycle. That ability is the compliment. The tweet also included a familiar name: Michael Chandler. McGregor ended the joke by reaffirming what has remained consistent whenever reality replaces theatrics—if McGregor fights, it will be Chandler. That consistency matters, especially in an industry that is rapidly shifting toward spectacle-driven matchmaking. The breakdown also explores why the Chandler matchup has become strangely complicated. Influential voices like Jon Anik have publicly questioned its appeal, while weight class confusion and main event expectations continue to cloud the conversation. What remains clear is that McGregor does not fight at 155 pounds anymore, and any return will likely involve unconventional terms. The most revealing moment revisited is McGregor’s blunt exchange with Chandler—ending with the now-infamous line: “You will do what you’re told.” Chandler had no rebuttal then, and three years later, none exists. McGregor’s power isn’t just drawing attention—it’s controlling direction. And whether the headlines are serious or silly, red panty night is still very real. #ConorMcGregor #MichaelChandler #FloydMayweather #UFC #MMA #FightBusiness #RedPantyNight #ChaelSonnen Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Did Gable Steveson choose the right mentor—or the most dangerous one to imitate? In this clip, Chael breaks down a thoughtful warning made by Brendan Schaub after Gable publicly referred to Jon Jones as a mentor. That single word carries weight. A mentor isn’t just someone you admire for what they do in competition—it’s someone whose life, habits, and decisions you may try to replicate. Jon Jones is one of the greatest fighters who has ever lived. There’s no debate there. But his path is unique, chaotic, and non-transferable. Brendan’s point wasn’t disrespect—it was responsibility. Young athletes don’t just copy success inside the cage; they often copy what happens outside of it too. I explain why Jon Jones’ career worked for Jon Jones—and why trying to follow that same blueprint is risky for anyone else. We also talk about mentorship, post-career purpose, and why greatness doesn’t automatically translate into guidance. There is only one Jon Jones. Admire him—but don’t try to become him.

      "description": "When a fighter says, “If I lose, I’m out,” you usually ignore it. But when Sean O’Malley says it, you have to stop and listen. In this clip, Chael Sonnen reacts to recent comments from O’Malley about his future following a loss to Merab Dvalishvili and ahead of a dangerous matchup with Song Yadong. O’Malley outlined a bold plan—beat Song, beat Petr Yan, reclaim gold, and make 2026 “the year of Suga.” But then came the line that changed the conversation: “If I lose-lose, I’m out.” Chael breaks down why this statement is different from the usual fighter talk. Most athletes can’t walk away—even if they want to. O’Malley is one of the rare exceptions. He’s made real money, avoided the financial traps that keep fighters stuck, and built a brand that survives outside the cage. That gives his words real weight. Chael also questions the logic behind the Song Yadong matchup, how the UFC matchmaking philosophy under Dana White works, and why every fight needs a clear “why”—because punches and kicks alone haven’t been enough for years. So if Sean O’Malley loses… is he actually done? That’s the question—and the answer isn’t as obvious as you think. 👉 Watch more fight analysis and behind-the-scenes breakdowns right here. #SeanOMalley #SugaSean #UFC #MMA #SongYadong #PetrYan #ChaelSonnen #FightAnalysis #CombatSports Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Chael Sonnen breaks down why Alex Pereira may be just one win away from ending the GOAT discussion entirely. To become UFC heavyweight champion, Pereira’s path is clear — but brutal. It likely runs through Tom Aspinall, Jon Jones, or Ciryl Gane. Whether it’s waiting for Aspinall, fighting for an interim title, or taking on Jon Jones directly, none of these options are easy — but all of them are possible. Chael explains how Pereira’s resume, combined with one more championship win at heavyweight, could put him in a category few fighters have ever reached. This isn’t hype. This is the math behind greatness.",

      "description": "Rumors popped up that Justin Gaethje was dealing with a staph infection—and almost immediately, Gaethje denied it. So what’s real, what’s noise, and what actually matters? In this clip, Chael Sonnen explains why skin infections like staph and ringworm have always been part of combat sports culture—and why the sudden panic around them is largely misplaced. From mandatory skin checks to disclosure rules with athletic commissions, Chael walks through how this process actually works behind the scenes. Most importantly, Chael addresses the only two questions that really count: Will the fight be canceled? And would something like this affect the odds? The short answer: no. According to publicly available betting data from DraftKings, the line hasn’t moved at all. That tells you everything you need to know about how seriously this is being taken by people who put money behind their opinions. Chael also explains why fighters sometimes downplay medical details, why antibiotics are routine and manageable, and why visible skin issues look far more dramatic to fans than they are in reality. This isn’t a scandal. It’s not new. And it’s not affecting the fight. 👉 For real fight analysis—not internet hysteria—watch more right here. #JustinGaethje #UFC #MMA #FightNews #ChaelSonnen #CombatSports #UFCRumors #SportsBetting Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",
