Then, the women‚Äôs strawweight belt is up for grabs in the co-main event. And it‚Äôs a rematch five years in the making when Virna Jandiroba takes on Mackenzie Dern.

That is the question when it comes to Reiner de Ridder and the decision to save him from being mauled by Brendan Allen in the fifth round last week in Vancouver.
