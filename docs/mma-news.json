      "description": "Dricus du Plessis says he’s ready to fight Khamzat Chimaev. The problem? That fight isn’t happening. And when a former champion resurfaces after being oddly quiet, this is the moment to control the narrative. Instead, DDP used words like “obviously” and “like I said” — and neither helps his position. There is nothing obvious about wanting to fight Chimaev. If anything, the optics say the opposite. More importantly, there’s no realistic scenario where the UFC books Dricus vs Chimaev next. DDP built his career by steering the ship. He demanded main card placement over Bo Nickal. He parlayed momentum into Robert Whittaker. Then into Sean Strickland. Then into a championship. That wasn’t luck. That was strategy. Right now, Dricus is in the most dangerous position in MMA — contender without a plan. If you don’t call your shot, the UFC will call it for you. And you won’t like their version as much as your own. If DDP wants his belt back, he needs to name the path. #UFC #DricusDuPlessis #KhamzatChimaev #Middleweight #MMA 0:00 Dricus Missed Here 1:10 Why “Obviously” Is a Problem 2:00 The Chimaev Reality 3:00 How DDP Built His Rise 4:45 The Danger of Not Calling Your Shot 6:00 What He Should Do Next Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "Khamzat hasn’t fought since August 2025, and Sean Strickland is calling him out hard. Strickland says he’s the only man who can beat Khamzat Chimaev and even claims “Fluffy” Hernandez is a better wrestler than Chimaev. Khamzat Chimaev is undefeated, a dominant force at middleweight, and now looks like his cardio issues are solved after going five rounds. If Chimaev fights next, it should be Nassourdine Imavov — unless the winner of Sean Strickland vs Brendan “Fluffy” Hernandez jumps the line. Strickland talks, Chimaev dominates, and Dricus Du Plessis needs to defend the UFC middleweight title soon. Middleweight just got interesting again. 🔒 Become a Member for special Perks, Exclusive Content and ultra-exclusive Live Chats: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrG2_1TcVkXKXXsD6Kjwig/join ▶️ Follow Michael on Social: https://www.instagram.com/mikebisping https://www.twitter.com/bisping https://www.facebook.com/mikethecountbisping ▶️ Edited by John Brannigan: https://www.instagram.com/johnbranniganuk https://www.twitter.com/johnbranniganuk #bisping #ufc #mma #mixedmartialarts #michaelbisping #ufcnews #mmanews #khamzatchimaev",

      "description": "Alex Pereira tweeted “1, 2, 3… go.” That sounds like one thing — a third UFC title. Alex Pereira is already a two division champion, former middleweight champion and light heavyweight champion. With Tom Aspinall recovering and Jon Jones likely retired, the UFC heavyweight title picture is wide open. If Tom Aspinall is sidelined, Alex Pereira vs Ciryl Gane for an interim UFC heavyweight title makes sense. Alex Pereira chasing a third belt would be historic.

      "description": "Tom Aspinall has reportedly been asked to vacate the UFC heavyweight championship — but is there truth behind the rumor? After a claim surfaced online and was later labeled a troll post, the story gained traction when Josh Thomson discussed it publicly. Now the bigger question isn’t whether Tom is being stripped… it’s whether the White House card changes everything. If Alex Pereira moves to heavyweight, does he fight Ciryl Gane? And if so, is there a belt attached? History tells us one thing: sitting UFC champions do not change weight classes unless a championship is on the line. Never just for “a fight.” That opens the door to a potential interim heavyweight title — not as punishment to Aspinall, but as a way to keep the division moving while Tom heals from an injury suffered inside the cage under illegal circumstances. With Pereira openly discussing heavyweight and never mentioning a light heavyweight defense, speculation is rising fast. The clock is ticking on White House announcements. #UFC #TomAspinall #AlexPereira #Heavyweight #whitehousecard 0:00 Aspinall Vacate Rumor Explained 1:25 Pereira to Heavyweight? 2:40 Why an Interim Belt Makes Sense 4:05 The White House Card Clue 5:40 What This Means for Tom Bad Guy Inc merch now available at https://BadGuyInc.com Click here to subscribe: https://bit.ly/3FrHIPK Follow me on IG: https://bit.ly/3HY7BIE Follow me on Twitter: https://bit.ly/3tvY5J7 Follow me on Threads https://www.threads.com/@sonnench",

      "description": "There’s real smoke right now around a potential super card — and if this comes together, it’s built around activity, star power, and guaranteed violence. The most likely headliner? Ilia Topuria vs Justin Gaethje. That’s action you can sell globally. Pressure vs precision. Durability vs finishing instinct. It feels like the kind of fight that headlines itself. Then you start stacking the card… If he’s unbooked, it’s very easy to imagine Alex Pereira getting placed in a co-main or feature spot. Few fighters bring instant main-event gravity the way he does. The guy I’m most confident shows up on this type of card? Michael Chandler. Activity matters. Readiness matters. Chandler has built a reputation on both. Very strong chance you also see Sean O'Malley somewhere on the lineup. He moves numbers. He brings eyeballs. That matters for cards like this. There’s also noise around Colby Covington vs Bo Nickal. If that gets announced, it instantly becomes one of the most talked-about fights on the entire event. As for Conor McGregor… momentum feels slower. Not impossible. Just not something you build a card around right now. But if you walk out of a meeting with Topuria headlining and Pereira on the same card under the Ultimate Fighting Championship banner… that’s a statement event. That’s the kind of card fans remember. #UFC #MMA #IliaTopuria #JustinGaethje #AlexPereira #MichaelChandler #SeanOMalley #ColbyCovington #BoNickal #ConorMcGregor",

But here’s the real question nobody asks the right way… Does the greatest fighter of all time need to be the cleanest athlete of all time? Because that’s where the conversation changes. If your son had to step into a cage tomorrow, and you could give him the complete skill set of one fighter ever — striking, grappling, fight IQ, creativity, adaptability — are you honestly not picking Jon Jones? Cleanest athlete ever? That’s a different list. Greatest fighter ever? That’s a different debate entirely. Every era of combat sports has gray areas. Rules evolve. Testing evolves. What never changes is what happens when the cage door shuts. Championships. Longevity. Solving every style put in front of you. Jon’s career forces a hard conversation: are we judging greatness by perfection outside the cage… or dominance and skill inside it? You don’t have to like the answer. But you do have to decide which question you’re actually asking.

Islam Makhachev vs Ilia Topuria is two prime, two division champions colliding in a true superfight. Yes, Justin Gaethje deserves his lightweight title shot, but Islam Makhachev vs Ilia Topuria is once in a lifetime. Islam Makhachev brings the size, wrestling, grappling and championship résumé. Ilia Topuria brings elite boxing and knockout power. Critics doubt Ilia Topuria against Islam Makhachev, but Ilia Topuria has finished champions in two divisions. Wrestling favors Islam Makhachev, striking favors Ilia Topuria. If the UFC wants the biggest possible fight for the White House card, Islam Makhachev vs Ilia Topuria is the fight to make, even if Justin Gaethje has to wait. 🔒 Become a Member for special Perks, Exclusive Content and ultra-exclusive Live Chats: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrG2_1TcVkXKXXsD6Kjwig/join #bisping #ufc #mma #mixedmartialarts #michaelbisping #ufcnews #mmanews #iliatopuria #islammakhachev",

      "description": "Mike Perry and Eddie Alvarez were at the same bare knuckle event — and things escalated quickly. In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen explains what happened between Mike Perry and the crew around Eddie Alvarez. According to Perry’s version, an exchange with Alvarez’s son and his girlfriend turned provocative, tempers flared, and within seconds the situation spiraled. At some point Perry went down — whether from a push, a slip, or a stumble — and that’s when multiple people swarmed him. It looked chaotic, messy, and like something that could’ve turned into a major legal issue. But here’s the twist: Perry isn’t upset. After speaking directly with Perry, Chael shares that Perry took responsibility for his role in the situation. He admitted he was drinking, admitted it was heated, and didn’t seem interested in escalating it further. No lawsuit talk. No revenge narrative. Just, “We were at a fight. Things got rowdy.” Given the history between Perry and Alvarez from their bare knuckle fight, maybe this wasn’t entirely surprising. Still, it’s one of the wildest off-cage moments of the weekend.

      "description": "Sean O’Malley might have just made the smartest callout of the year. After back surgery, Petr Yan is rumored to be lining up a fight with Merab Dvalishvili — but O’Malley stepped in with a different idea. His pitch? Don’t fight the guy who beat me. Fight me. I’m the easier fight. Only Sean O'Malley could sell that without threats, profanity, or theatrics. It was pure strategy. Merab is a relentless, grinding nightmare. O’Malley is offering a high-profile rematch with controversy already baked in. Let’s not forget — Yan vs O’Malley the first time was razor close and heavily debated. Add two more rounds to make it a five-round fight, and suddenly the story changes completely. Different pacing. Different conditioning. Different outcome potential. There’s also unfinished business. Yan has a loss to O’Malley on his record. Against Merab, he already holds a win. So what’s the smarter move if you’re coming off surgery? This ultimately comes down to what the fans want. The UFC historically rewards fighters who show up and do favors. Merab has done that. But O’Malley just made a compelling case. So what’s the bigger fight — Yan vs Merab, or Yan vs O’Malley 2?

      "description": "I might have been wrong about the White House card. When the idea first surfaced, I believed it would be a standard UFC event — big, yes, but structured like UFC 100, 200, 300, Madison Square Garden, or Sphere. A title fight on top, maybe another in the co-main, and that’s it. But then two important pieces of information came out. First, Jon Anik suggested we could see as many as seven title fights. When Jon speaks about the future, you listen. Second, Ari Emanuel said the White House card may only feature six or seven fights total. That changes the math entirely. If the event only has six or seven fights, each one likely stretches longer — possibly five-round championship bouts. Add in the fact that no UFC title fights are currently booked, and suddenly the detective work starts to make sense. Could Islam Makhachev, Ilia Topuria, Alex Pereira, or even a heavyweight rematch find their way onto that stage? I don’t have inside information. But when the matchmakers meet and everyone wants on that card, something special is coming. I may have to change my mind — and that doesn’t happen often.

In this breakdown, Chael Sonnen reacts to comments from Daniel Cormier regarding Jon Jones and his recent statements about needing a hip replacement. Jones claimed he has arthritis, can’t wrestle properly, and wants to preserve what’s left of his body for his family. Later, he suggested he didn’t know he was being recorded when those comments surfaced. Cormier pushed back. Not because of the recording — but because he believes Jon is subconsciously coming to terms with being finished. According to DC, this isn’t about meta glasses or narrative control. It’s about a fighter realizing the “car” isn’t the same anymore. Chael reflects on that moment every fighter eventually faces — when training stops feeling automatic and retirement becomes real for the first time. He compares it to noticing every flaw in a car the moment you start thinking about replacing it. The problems were always there — but now you see them differently. The question isn’t whether Jon can still win. It’s whether he still wants the life that comes with it. And if DC is right, that answer may already be decided.

We’re not debating the cleanest fighter of all time. We’re debating the greatest fighter of all time — and those are two very different conversations. In this video, I break down why Jon Jones’ legacy can’t just be erased because he got caught. Look at the résumé: youngest champ ever, undefeated for over a decade, dominated legends, solved every style, moved to heavyweight and took the belt. Skill for skill, fight IQ, creativity, composure under pressure — nobody has ever looked more complete inside the Octagon. Here’s the uncomfortable truth about MMA: every era has gray areas. Rules change. Substances change. Testing changes. If you’re going to disqualify Jon completely, you’d have to rewrite the sport’s entire history. So what really defines greatness? Dominance? Championships? Longevity? Or perfection outside the cage? Love him or hate him, Jon Jones might still be the most talented fighter we’ve ever seen.

If you thought Ilia was getting an immediate super fight — think again. Gaethje isn’t just a placeholder. He’s a problem. Relentless pressure. Endless gas tank. Pure violence. Nobody walks through Justin clean. Meanwhile, Conor’s return, catchweight talks, and the White House card rumors are creating chaos across three divisions. Titles. Contenders. Superfights.

      "description": "Ilia Topuria isn’t just fighting opponents anymore. Now he’s fighting pressure. There’s a difference between competing because you want to… and competing because you have to. Up until now, Topuria fought like a free man — confident, loose, dangerous. But when the money changes, when the responsibilities stack up, when the paydays get split and the business gets heavier? That’s when a fighter finds out who he really is. Chael Sonnen breaks down the reality nobody talks about: finances change psychology. Does that make Ilia hungrier? Or does it tighten him up? Because once you’re fighting to earn instead of fighting for love, everything shifts. And while fans dream about Ilia Topuria vs Islam Makhachev super fights, the UFC doesn’t work that way. You don’t jump divisions and skip the line without defending your belt first. There’s a process. Which is why the most logical — and most violent — answer is sitting right in front of us: Justin Gaethje. No warm-up. No easy night. No favors. Just a dogfight with the most dangerous lightweight in the sport. If Topuria wants to prove he’s built different, this is the test. Because Gaethje doesn’t let you coast. You either break… or you become undeniable. #IliaTopuria #JustinGaethje #IslamMakhachev #UFC #MMA #Lightweight #FightNews #ChaelSonnen",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/shorts/0LDBOAR69nA",
      "description": "Michael Chandler just did what Michael Chandler always does — he showed up ready to fight… anybody. While the MMA world speculates about Conor McGregor, the BMF title, and a potential White House mega-event, Chandler kept it simple: June 14th, he’s in. No drama. No waiting. No “maybe.” He calls himself the most reliable, most electrifying guy on the roster — and honestly, history backs that up. Chael Sonnen breaks down why that mindset matters. Chandler isn’t sitting around hoping for the Conor fight. Sure, he wants it — everybody does — but if it doesn’t materialize, he’s already lining up options. After Justin Gaethje vs. Paddy Pimblett, Chandler gave respect to both: Gaethje for proving he’s elite, Paddy for being tougher than people thought. And then? He casually says he’d love another crack at Paddy too. That’s vintage Chandler. Stay active. Stay dangerous. Stay visible. While other guys negotiate, Chandler competes. Whether it’s McGregor, Pimblett, or anyone else, he’s planting a flag right now: put me on the card. Because when a big stage shows up — especially one as wild as the White House lawn — you want the guy who always says yes. #MichaelChandler #ConorMcGregor #JustinGaethje #PaddyPimblett #UFC #BMF #MMA #ChaelSonnen",

      "link": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMKqiavNpkU",
      "description": "Jon Jones is one of the greatest talents the sport has ever seen — but right now, his situation doesn’t create urgency, excitement, or direction. It creates something else. Eh. This discussion breaks down why Jon Jones’ current status — retirement talk, medical issues, an eight-day exit and return, and the absence from the rankings — hasn’t actually changed the landscape of the UFC heavyweight division. Nothing was canceled.No title was delayed.No must-see fight disappeared. That’s the problem. Using a Super Bowl commercial as the analogy, this episode explores why fans, media, and even the business side of the sport are stuck in neutral when it comes to Jon Jones — despite his greatness. Key questions addressed: * Why the eight-day retirement mattered more than it seemed * Why there is no clear heavyweight fight people are demanding * Why a “comeback” only works if you actually leave * How Jon Jones could have been in a very different position today * Why fantasy matchmaking doesn’t solve real problems This isn’t criticism.It’s context. And until something changes, the answer to “do you care?” remains the same: Eh. CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — The SetupJon Jones, retirement talk, injuries, and why the reaction isn’t yes or no. 0:29 — The “Eh” Super Bowl CommercialWhy indifference is worse than anger or excitement. 0:45 — The Eight-Day MistakeHow leaving and returning immediately changed everything. 1:14 — Why This Wasn’t a ComebackWhy a real comeback requires absence, buildup, and timing. 1:32 — The Love Jon Hasn’t Felt YetWhy true appreciation often comes after retirement. 2:15 — Nothing Actually ChangedNo fights canceled, no titles delayed, no disruption. 2:49 — The Heavyweight Reality CheckWhy there isn’t a must-see heavyweight fight right now. 3:15 — Fantasy vs RealityWhy light heavyweight ideas don’t solve a heavyweight problem. 3:49 — The White House QuestionIf Jon fights there… against who? 4:28 — Business Didn’t MoveWhy media, marketing, and momentum stayed flat. 4:50 — Supporting Jon RegardlessWhy respect for his career remains unchanged. 5:05 — Rankings and RealityWhy matching him with ranked heavyweights still leads to the same feeling. 5:56 — How Did It Get Here?Tracing the timeline back to the pivotal decision. 6:20 — Final ThoughtWhy the only answer left right now is still… eh.

      "description": "The matchmaker meeting for the White House UFC card is happening — and the picture is starting to take shape. While there’s still uncertainty around the total number of fights and the final structure of the card, certain names are beginning to stand out as likely participants. This breakdown looks at: * What’s been publicly suggested about the size of the card * Which fighters appear most likely to be booked * Why certain stars make sense — and others don’t * How the UFC historically approaches special-event cards * Why some rumored matchups face practical resistance One name stands above the rest in terms of certainty, while others depend on timing, availability, and momentum. Rather than fantasy matchmaking, this is about path of least resistance — how these cards are actually built behind the scenes. There are still unknowns, including potential returns, injury timelines, and whether certain long-discussed matchups are realistic right now. But if you’re looking for the most probable direction — not the loudest rumor — this is where the board currently points. CHAPTER BREAKDOWNS 0:00 — The Matchmaker MeetingWhy this meeting matters and what’s actually being discussed. 0:14 — How Many Fights Are We Talking About?Clarifying the six-or-seven fight comment and why it’s unusual. 0:28 — The Safest Bet on the CardWhy Michael Chandler appears most likely to be booked. 1:09 — The Star Power EquationWhy international stars factor heavily into this card. 1:34 — Alex Pereira’s Likely PlacementWhy Pereira makes sense — and why nothing extreme is expected. 1:52 — Building From ScratchWhy certain matchups face resistance despite big names. 2:33 — Sean O’Malley and Colby CovingtonWhy their inclusion feels likely, even with unanswered questions. 2:45 — The Bo Nickal FactorWhy some fighters may find each other by process of elimination. 3:31 — Why McGregor Isn’t in the MixPath of least resistance and why effort isn’t being spent there. 3:50 — Champions, Belts, and OpticsHow interim and specialty titles factor into marquee cards. 4:24 — Ilia vs Gaethje as the Main EventWhy this matchup checks the most boxes. 5:06 — Do You Need an American Headliner?Why history suggests the answer is no. 5:23 — The Amanda Nunes VariableWhy timing and health make this the biggest unknown. 5:36 — Final PredictionWhy Ilia Topuria and Alex Pereira on the same card feels like the outcome.

      "description": "Jon Jones made major headlines after getting filmed saying he has severe arthritis he's dealing with. Daniel Cormier IS BACK to give his reaction to the viral video revealing Jon's injuries, and why \"it's a sad day\" to see Jones is finally doing fighting in the sport. DC GOES IN ON why he thinks there's NO WAY Jones will wrestle him after this news came out, and that we should get ready to now see the end of Jones' career in the UFC. See why Cormier thinks Jon is actually okay with the news coming out, despite his public comments claiming he didn't know he was being filmed. And with Justin Gaethje vs. Ilia Topuria almost certainly headlining the White House, DC gives his take on the future UFC title fight.
